MustLoveHamster,None,False,False,False,11kwr75,False,False,t3_11kwr75,Something triggered more memories,"This morning I remembered a story told to me by my mom, who had in turn heard it from her mom, my grandmother.

In the late 1930s, my grandmother was a young woman living on a farm in Yorkshire, England. She would walk to and from school every day along country lanes surrounding the farm.

One winter afternoon as she was walking back home she saw a man lying in the middle of the road, covered in what she assumed was mud. It was getting dark, but she described him wearing a light trench coat and the mud was very bold, as it contrasted in blotches against the fabric.

Even in sleepy 1930s rural England young women knew the dangers posed by strange men. As the whole scene looked so odd, she decided to go out of her way and walk through farmland back to her home.

She told her parents about it. Her father went to see for himself, but found nothing there. That was the end of it.

A year later she walked back from school and when she got home her parents told her there had been an accident. A man had been found near the farm, he'd either been trampled by a horse or hit with a car. The man was dead. They told her not to go into the kitchen as that was where his body was being kept while they waited for help.

Curiosity got the better of her of course. She looked in the kitchen and on the table she immediately recognized the same man she'd seen lying in the road a year earlier. Only this time, she realized the dark blotches on his coat weren't mud, it was blood.

I believe this story to be true, simply because it was told to me by my mom, and to her by her mom. What happened though? Did she have a premonition? Was it some weird time travelling ghost manifestation? 

I've not heard of a similar story that I can remember.",6,47.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11kwr75/something_triggered_more_memories/,False,2023-03-07 11:26:56,False,False,False,0.98,,,,
BLACKHAWK4537,None,False,False,False,11l9h3e,False,False,t3_11l9h3e,I was haunted/possessed,"This is going to be a long one and I'm only including the major events that happened. Id also like to say i am dyslexic so dont go mad at my spelling and  grammer please haha. 
So it all started when I was 9 and stopped when I was 18 I'm currently 25 now and still think back to those days and just want to know if anyone had any similar experiences or to know if anyone has any theory's on what it may have all been? Back then I full on believed in ghost but now I find my self trying to rationalise the things I seen and felt. 

So my first case of it was with whats now called sleep paralysis where I had a sleep paralysis demon every night for a good year I'd wake up in the middle of the night frozen, a large figure would creep into my room it's had to explain what it looked like because it makes no sense but it was a 6-7 foot tall figure with arms and fingers abnormaly long with a round smooth head and no identifiable features bar from his over all shape the part that's had to describe is its colour it was so dark and black that it stud out from the darkest corners of the room but yet was transparent and it was possible to see what was behind it.
It used to walk into my room and look around at all my old toys until it got to a particular shelf and pause there. I was literally unable to move anything but my eyes to watch it walk around, but at that point when it paused something clicked in me and I was able to pull the covers over my head, I'd wait a while and remove them, and there would be nothing there any more. So I would run to my parents room and sleep with them scared for my life I'd say it was a bad dream, the next few months after this exact thing happend like clock work the same figure the same actions, being paralysed upto the point it would stop at the shelf every night. But then it got worse I wasn't able to snap out of paralysis as quick anymore, after it paused it would slowly look over directly at me and then take a step in my direction, I snapped out of paralysis at this point and repeated the process, pull blankets over my head wait till its safe go sleep in my parents room, say it was a bad dream. 
For the next week it started getting closer and closer while still repeating the exact same actions it had done every other night before, and each time it took me longer to pull up the covers. It eventually started lifting its arm up reaching out to me. I was able to stop it in time but on the last night it's hand was right in my face still no identifiable features just long pointy fingers right by my face, for the last time I was able to pull up the covers and go to my parents room. But this night was diffrent shortly after falling asleep in their bed I woke up again paralysed and at the end of the bed was that figure looking directly at me shaking its head. For what felt like hours I looked at it shaking its head at me in disappointment, like it was disappointed in its self but angry at me. 
I never had that same experience again with sleep paralysis. About 2 years after I had moved to a new house had almost forgot about the expiriance but seemly out of no where I started seeing new shadows while awake and lucid.

I'd see them multiple ones, diffrent shapes and sizes diffrent places but alway when it was dark enough out and they didnt seem to notice me they either just stud there stairing at random items or wandering around, the odd few would see me and stair at me but nothing more than that, during the day I would hear whispers of my name trying to catch my attention altho that wasn't regular but common enough to mention it. 
By the time I was 15 my mental health was on a sharp decline for multiple reasons this whole expiriance included and I had come to the point I was suicidal but every time I was about to end it the fear of what would happen to me in the after life terrified me, what if these things I was seeing would do something or what if I became one. The thought of that is realistically what kept me alive. I had seen one or 2 waching me once or twice as I tried to end it. 
I eventually wanted to know what I was expirianceing so I googled it to figure it out and knowing that some people had reported similar things made me less afraid I even made a freind in school who used to see one with sleep paralysis but hadn't seen one since unlike me. After some time I began to enjoy seeing them it made me feel unique or special, but that changed quickly. The more I grew to like them and observe them the more they started to observe me and then it started to become aggressive I was constantly under watch when I was out at night if I had company or not they where there and they stated becoming more noticeable. 

I was in transition year on work experience with my dad we fixed up council houses. One of them was abandoned the owner moved out nothing seemed unique about it but I walked in and the air was heavy or something house was freezing but that's not uncommon in a house someone hasn't lived in for a few weeks. So my dad left me to rip out the old carpet while he went and looked at another job at first working there seemed ok but then I noticed doors being open that I didn't open, there wasn't any drafts in the house either and given my history I was very freaked out but chose to ignore it thinking that these things had never interacted with physical items before why now ? But no I was wrong footsteps where heard in the attick doors started creaking not all out once but over the 2 hours I was there it happened periodically I tried rationalising it in my head but then when I seen a door slam shut right in fount of me I said nah and got the hell out of there. Stepping outside the air felt lighter compared to in house. 

Some time had past since that event and it was like the shadow people I used to see so many of started  disappearing I was seeing way less than normal just maybe one or so every few nights. One of the nights I seen one in the far end of my room but ignored it closed my eyes and tried to sleep, I was shattered after a long day and had no energy, my legs started to feel lighter like I was floating way thinking to my self this Is going to be a nice sleep... then the end of my bed hit the floor and my legs bounced off the mattress. I was frozen in compleat fear of what just happened but with the fear of what I might see if I looked at the end of my bed I keept my eyes closed and pretended to be asleep the air was heavy again I didn't sleep much that night. 

The worst of all these experiences came a few months after that I'm 17 now I'm no longer feeling suicidal or anything, and the shadow people became way less common. It was bright out I was eating my dinner with a fork and stake knife in my room the TV was in frount of me but it wasn't on so I could see myself and everything behind me in the reflection. I looked up at it and seen a strange black shadow infrount of my jackets hanging on my door. It looked almost like a person with a quilt over them sort of like a cheap ghost costume for Halloween but was still pitch black but transparent like all the other shadow people ive seen. When I seen it in the reflection I turned around to see what it was but nothing was there I looked back at the TV reflection  and it was standing directly behind me so I freaked out and turned around again jumping out of my chair but there was nothing again, the reflection showed nothing either. I was about to sit down and eat again when I started getting these violent depressing angry feelings and thoughts. I was so angry with myself and depressed at the same time and couldn't help but feel like I needed to kill myself. So I grabbed the stake knife I was using to eat with and put it to my wrists, then I snapped out of it this isn't right why would I do this? Then it came over me again this unbelievable urge to want to die and cut myself. I threw away the knife snapping back to my normal self this keept happing it was like tug of war with myself trying not to kill myself, picking up the knife and holding it to my arms and quickly pulling away. I started crying overwhelmed with these emotions I didn't understand and came on so suddenly. But I fought the urge off and after about 20 minutes the urge was gone, I felt like me again. I didn't notice anything leaving the room or my body if it was some sort of possession. 

A bit after that I started seeing more shadow people again. Until I was 18, on this particular day I had a bad day was angry I can't remember at what, but I was in bed trying to seep and I felt eyes watching me. Sure enough there was an abnormaly tall shadow person standing at the end of my bed watching me and me still being angry I told it to fuck off. This was actully the first time I tried talking to one directly, but it didn't listen so I sat up and said it with a slightly louder whisper ""fuck off"" and I keept repeating that getting louder and louder unitl I broke and screamed it at the top of my lungs and when I did, it did fuck off, just vanished. My parents came running into my room thinking there was an intruder that was hard to try and explain to them everything that's been happing to me. I never told them until then. It was also the last time I had ever seen one.
If you have read this far thankyou for listening I haven't told a lot of people this and its kinda nice to get it out.

ocean_eyes07,None,False,False,False,11l35a7,False,False,t3_11l35a7,Heartbeats,"I am a tenth grader...and right now I'm having my board exams. For those who don't know its the first set of public exams we face as students in India. I have always had a habit of studying at night as I am mentally much more comfortable with the silence as a result of which I can concentrate better. This sometimes proves as a curse but 99 times out of 100 its a boon in disguise.
I should make it clear that I have lived in rented houses(a very common thing in India) all my life. I shifted cities 3 years back and I have never felt any kind of presence anywhere near me...and to be very frank I am grateful for that. I am very much of a scaredy-cat and am a fan of English Literature in general, irrespective of the author. However I still enjoy following up on spooky details here and there. 
That, was just the backstory...so last night I was solving papers on Maths(the next paper is Math so wish me luck...its my fav subject too)and was pondering over a sum. I would take a guess that it was around 2:30-3 a.m. ish. I tend to switch the fan off in my room when I do Maths because I feel even the sound of the fan to be a distraction when I'm trying to concentrate. You get the idea. I like it deathly quiet to the extent that I can hear my own breath. Naturally, everybody in my house was asleep. My parents' room is just adjacent to mine and I could hear their soft breath in the quiet of the night. 
However the abnormal thing was, it was followed by heartbeats. Distinct sound of a healthy heart beating right behind me. I dropped my pen from the shock. It felt like it was right next to my ears and it was shockingly loud. We are a nuclear family of three living in a rented apartment in suburban Mumbai and in all the three years I have lived here I have only experienced positive vibes in the environment. This felt different. It felt like whatever it was, it was not here to do any harm neither was it here to do any good. However it lasted only about five seconds. I usually keep the small balcony to my room open for a breath of cool breeze blowing in but at this point I noticed even that had stopped. I was sweating profusely and was scared out of my wits so I resorted to the idea of snuggling up to my mother for the night. I'd had enough. 
I tossed and turned all throughout the night.
My parents however did not believe me when I told them about whatever was in my room. They just brushed it off as my over-active imagination with an alternative of me being extremely sleepy. To make it crystal clear I NEVER do Math when I'm sleepy so no I was not.
Posting it here hoping my fellow redditors will believe me and offer any possible logical explanations they can find or might know of. Thanks and peace✌️",4,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11l35a7/heartbeats/,False,2023-03-07 16:00:56,False,False,False,0.78,,,,

Strange things would happen without explanation, and an eerie feeling would often linger in the air. One night, I woke up to the sound of footsteps coming from the hallway, but when I opened my door, no one was there. Another time, I found a toy that I had lost months prior sitting in the middle of my room, as if it had been placed there deliberately.

But the most vivid experience I had was when I was home alone and heard someone whisper my name. I called out, thinking it was a family member, but there was no response. Suddenly, the lights flickered and the room grew colder. I felt a presence in the room with me, and I knew without a doubt that it was not human.

I never felt unsafe in my childhood home, but the unexplainable occurrences definitely left an impression on me.

Now after working at several large hospitals I really don’t know if I believe any more. I’ve never seen or experienced anything paranormal, I’ve spent time on empty floors, mechanical spaces at all hours of the day/night. The creepy feeling that you’d expect isn’t there either, most parts of the hospital are downright peaceful when there’s nobody there. 
I’ve also been involved with a renovation of the original main building of the hospital (which dates back to the 1910’s). You’d think that with a ton of changes going on in such an old space there would be tons of activity but again there’s no activity, no feelings of dread or creepiness.

MustLoveHamster,None,False,False,True,11kaass,False,False,t3_11kaass,"Edge Hill, Warwickshire, England","About a million years ago before I emigrated to the States, I lived near Warwick in England.

Not far from there is Edge Hill. From wikipedia:

***Edge Hill*** *is an* [*escarpment*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escarpment) *and* ***Edgehill***[*\[1\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Hill,_Warwickshire#cite_note-BBCCov-1)[*\[2\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Hill,_Warwickshire#cite_note-2) *a* [*hamlet*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamlet_(place)) *in the* [*civil parish*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_parishes_in_England) *of* [*Ratley*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ratley) *and* [*Upton*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Upton_House,_Warwickshire)*,* [*Stratford-on-Avon District*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stratford-on-Avon_District)*, southern* [*Warwickshire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warwickshire)*, England. At Ratley, the escarpment rises to 219 m (719 ft) above sea level and 112 m (367 ft) above nearby* [*Radway*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radway)*, within 300 metres of the Warwickshire border with* [*Oxfordshire*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oxfordshire)*.*[*\[3\]*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_Hill,_Warwickshire#cite_note-3)

*Edge Hill gave its name to the first battle of the* [*English Civil War*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Civil_War)*, in which it was a prominent feature.*

That part about the battle is why you're reading this now.

It was 1999 and I was a typical rebellious teenager. A good friend of mine was a huge X-Files and other supernatural phenomenon fanatic. Everything weird that happened he put down to 'spirits'. Picture that Giorgio Tsoukalos guy with the funny hair who blames everything on ALIENS! That was my friend, except it was ghosts.

My friend told me that some of his friends from work shared his interests and someone had suggested a trip to Edge Hill on the anniversary night of the civil war battle there. Now, I'm not a skeptic, I do find paranormal stuff interesting, but walking around a field in the middle of the night wasn't high on my list of things to do.

He was a really good friend though and so I went.

We all met up at a pub near the battlefield and, as I feared, I was the only girl with about 5 or 6 guys. I've told others this story and when I say it started in the pub, the normal reaction is, oh right, started in a pub.....

Well it did start in a pub, but no one was drunk. Back then I was a Bud girl and one bottle was all I had.

We walked down a lane in the dark, until there was a gap in the hedge and a style for us to climb over. Then there we were, the top of Edge Hill. It really was dark, really dark, but with flashlights we found a ceremonial sign thing that explained what happened at the site.

We walked down the hill, which was muddy, and slippery, and got to the bottom of that field, climbed another style and started to walk down the next field. We were about half way across the second field when I noticed two lights in the next field. Like I said, it was really, really, dark, but these lights appeared to be roughly at head height and roughly half way across that field.

I pointed the lights out to the others and as we **all** watched, two more lights appeared, also at head height. Everyone stopped dead in their tracks. We all just looked at these lights. I've tried to describe before what they looked like and the best description I've ever come up with was as if an average size person attached a flashlight on each side of their head. We could see two people doing that, we assumed.

We nervously discussed what we could see and someone suggested it was just a couple of locals, out to play a trick on anyone stupid enough to visit Edge Hill on the anniversary.

Boys being boys, a couple of lads shouted over to the lights. A sort of ""come and have a go if you think you're hard enough"" and absolutely nothing happened. Until.... the lights started to move toward us. We still had a hedge between us and them and we were on higher ground that slopped away toward the lights.

Now you have to picture the scene, 5 or 6 young men were hurling abuse at what they thought was a just a couple of locals, taunting them to fight. Surely if those lights had been people messing around, they would stopped, turned off the lights and gone home, not continued moving toward a guaranteed arse kicking.

I told my friend I'd had enough and I started walking back up the hill. The rest of the party joined us and when we looked back we could see the lights were in the same field as us now. This is when it all went nuts.

We were all trying to climb up this muddy field, slipping and falling and of course shitting ourselves now. The faster we tried to move, the more we slipped, it was almost comical, except we were all having heart attacks.

Eventually we got to the top of the field and feeling braver we decided to sit down on a bench up there. Those of us that smoked, did so. I then noticed large black objects moving around in the field. It wasn't so much that I could see the objects, as I could see the background being momentarily hidden as these things moved in front. Way down the fields there was the side of a Ministry of Defense base at Kineton. We could see that very well lt up, and then we'd see these black objects moving between us and those lights. It slowly became clear that these objects were horses. Dozens and dozens of black horses. We'd just been down and then back up this field and not seen or heard a single horse, now they were everywhere.

I don't know how long we sat there. We did eventually all try at the same time to scramble over the style back onto the country lane. Once back on the lane and feeling relatively brave again, we discussed what had happened. It was at that moment that we heard a horse neighing, but LOUD, like it was right behind us. Of course, there was nothing there.

So what did we see that night? What really happened? I have no fucking clue. I've never experienced anything like it since.",2,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11kaass/edge_hill_warwickshire_england/,False,2023-03-06 18:58:10,False,False,False,0.89,,,,
pastelghost421,None,False,False,False,11jrm0z,False,False,t3_11jrm0z,Ghost on the Intercom…,"Some context:
When I was in my early teens I believe I was followed by the spirit of a young girl. I believe she inhabited one of my porcelain dolls my grandmother had given me. Often I’d see her in dreams or feel her presence. I can’t explain it, but I feel like she may have been the ghost in this story. 

My parents used to live in a big 3 story house that had an old built in intercom. There were speakers in every room of the house (minus bathrooms) and even though it was old, we still liked playing around with it every now and then.

You’d have to have the speaker turned on and turn the volume all the way up usually to even hear anything clearly. 
You also had to physically push a button to speak into it. 

Once in a while the intercom would come on by itself and play something on the radio. I found this spooky but my mom brushed it off as the past owner having set an alarm via the intercom so that the radio would come on at certain times.
We didn’t know how to reprogram it, hard as my stepdad tried and my parents were tired of often getting woken up at 3am by  the radio randomly coming on through the intercom in their room.
So we decided to just not use it anymore and turned all the intercoms off, with the volume all the way down just as an extra measure. 

One night I was chatting online with my friends on the computer, and I hadn’t noticed the time was around 3am. 
Suddenly the intercom came on in my room at full blast. 
It was horribly loud static coming through. 
I jumped up to shut it off but as I reached for the volume dial I saw it was already at 0/off.
I didn’t know how to make the noise stop.

Then through the static I faintly heard what sounded like someone breathing… and then I heard the voice of a little girl. 

She said, “when will you come to your senses…” and then just as fast as it had come on, the intercom shut off.

Silence.

I was FROZEN with fear.
Being a teen, I jumped back on the computer to tell my friends what had just happened and they said “GET OUT OF THAT HOUSE!”
I had to go tell my parents.
The hallway was pitch black and I had to go all the way down a big staircase in the dark to their room. I held my breath and flung my door open, sprinting down the stairs, crying from how scared I was.
I banged loudly on my parents door and I heard my mom yelp.
She opened the door and I ran in to tell them what had happened. 
They were more upset I woke them up.
My mom told me it was probably just a commercial on the radio or something.

I mentioned how my intercom had been turned off with the volume down to 0 and also what kind of “commercial” would say something like that?!

Seeing as it was so late she didn’t feel like trying to rationalize it.
I was sent back up to bed. And if you guessed I didn’t sleep that night, you’d be correct.",2,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11jrm0z/ghost_on_the_intercom/,False,2023-03-06 07:13:08,False,False,False,1.0,,,,
TheeScoob,None,False,False,False,11jqkie,False,False,t3_11jqkie,Someone Came In Through The Garage,"I had an unexplainable experience occur about 5 years ago.  

I was a junior in high school. After the school day was over, my best bud at the time and I went over to his dad's house. With the house to ourselves, our plan was to hunker down in his room and play MCC Halo 2 on legendary and see truly how hard the game is. (it's hard).   

We're in the middle of the level Outskirts, just before you reach Jackal sniper alley, and in the next room over we heard a noise. The adjacent room was the parallel laundry room, which had a closed door to the garage. The garage door's handle squeaks. Our ears catch the noise, and we pause the game just as the door creaks allllll the way open. We are staring out the bedroom door, into the hallway. We can see the doorway of the laundry room, but not into the room itself. We were expecting to see who was coming in from the garage, assuming it was his dad. 

Instead, the garage door SLAMS shut so hard we could feel it connect with the wall. We. Are. Stunned. We start freaking out because no one else should be home right now, so I immediately assume there's an intruder. We gather some random items to use as weapons and literally breached the garage like fuggin Rainbow 6 Siege. We stacked up and opened the door as I yelled ""WHOEVER THE F\*CK IS IN HERE, COME OUT RIGHT F\*CKIN NOW!""   

Silence. Stale silence, and utter darkness. We flipped the lights on and begin a search of the garage, I tell my buddy to check if the side door to the backyard is locked. It is. While he looks around outside, I make note that there are no windows in this garage. No feasible escape that wouldn't leave a trace for us to find. All there were was my bud's dad's old unused rusty truck, and a bunch of empty cabinets. Yes. I searched the cabinets. No one was in the garage except us.  

I've told multiple people this story, and over the years, not a single explanation I haven't already accounted for and disproved. The obvious question is: Wind? No. I've had wind open or close doors before and you know when it's the wind. Besides, we would've heard the garage rattling if the wind was hard enough to open and slam a door.  

I would like to note, there is a possibility someone actually did break in and manually opened a garage door to slide out under it, but that is so unlikely. Not only would we have heard it move, but it would make so much more sense to just hit the garage hanger button.  

There is also the possibility that in the midst of the panic my bud mistook the side door for being locked when it actually wasn't.   no matter which way you cut it, I have a freaky ghost/home intruder story.",0,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11jqkie/someone_came_in_through_the_garage/,False,2023-03-06 06:19:26,False,False,False,0.94,,,,

eclectic_boogaloo2,None,False,False,False,11in302,False,False,t3_11in302,Friend’s country house,"When I was around 12 years old, my best friend and his family moved to the country on a large tract of land with several buildings. 

The first was an old house that had been the original residence before the previous owner started to construct a new house towards the back of the property. I had stayed there once when they first bought the property while the old owner was still packing up the other house, but I don’t recall much about that night. We had spent all day walking around the land, I just remember being so tired, I went to bed before 8!

The weekend that they moved in to the new house, they invited me to stay the weekend with them. It was a nice, new house that the previous owner had built, but didn’t quite finish it. It wasn’t until years later that I found out it was because his wife had passed away and he just couldn’t finish it, so he put it up for sale. It was just a large ground floor that he designed to be accessible and a large basement that was largely unfinished.

When you would go down the stairs to the basement, it opened up into a large room with wood paneling that he had intended to turn into a den, connected to a workshop by a door, all just revealing the concrete floor. Through the workshop there was another door that led into the garage. He had built a nice long workbench out of wood, but it had largely look unused.

That weekend, we had moved down a couple of couches, furniture, a handful of rugs and most importantly, the tv and video game systems. After moving everything in, we spent that evening staying up late playing video games. 

I must had fallen asleep on my couch first because when I first woke up, I could see the static of the tv still on the tv. I was cold and tired, so I just cozied up and when back to sleep. A little while later, I had awoke and saw his mom walk down the stairs in a robe. I assumed she just wanted to check on us and turn the tv off. I quickly closed my eyes, so she wouldn’t think I was awake and left the tv on. After a few moments, I could still hear the slight hiss of the tv and expected it to turn off any moment, but it didn’t. I slowly started to open an eye to peak and his mom was standing right in front of the tv staring at us. I thought this was weird and quickly closed my eyes. Trying to picture his mom, I suddenly realized, this person is too tall and thin. This woman was not his mom. Slowly opening an eye, I looked down at the tv and the glow of the static was seemingly passing through a set of legs before disappearing at the feet. Quickly closing my eyes, I tried to imagine I was anywhere else.

The next morning I was the first one up, but didn’t want to say anything since they just moved in. The next few times I would visit, I would stay in his room in a sleeping bag on the floor and we would play video games there. It was while looking back, I don’t think we ever spent much time down there. 

This past year when we finally reconnected after many years, I asked him if he ever had any paranormal experiences at his house. His first response was his basement, he didn’t say what, but his cats avoided it and he felt some kind of presence down there, he said he just avoids it when he’s there.

ainsleyadams,None,False,False,False,11imdsz,False,False,t3_11imdsz,Something happened at the Funeral Home,"At another point in time, I longed to own and operate a funeral home. If I had the money, I think I still would. To get a feel for what I wanted, I applied and eventually landed a job as a funeral attendant.

I loved this job.

The responsibilities of a funeral attendant vary. You could be working a visitation or service, transferring the deceased to/from hospitals, chapels and churches. You might be the designated limo driver for family and friends or the coach driver bringing a loved one to their final resting place. What I enjoyed and got pride in doing most, and what brought me to this subreddit today, was managing cremations.

I have many stories derived from my time at the Funeral Home, but only one made me reconsider the possibility of life after death. This is a true story.

Submitted for the approval of the r/Ghoststories subreddit...

She was only 17 when she took her life after a breakup with her boyfriend. I was assigned to her visitation, drove the limo for her family, and would eventually handle her cremation. Her family was incredibly nice, and I think of their daughter every time I have Diet Pepsi; her favourite drink.

It was the night of her visitation, the coffee was hot, the cookies were fresh, but most importantly, the Diet Pepsi was cold. The family would begin to arrive around seven that night, filling the entrance and common area with soft small talk and sniffles.

You do your best to welcome and make everyone feel comfortable, let them settle in for a bit before doing what I always found most difficult, remind them why a certain set of doors weren't open, and why it is important to only open them when they were ready.

I will never forget the screams of her mother seeing her for the first time, or how worried I was that her hair would fall out of place and make visible the scars and bruising that makeup could only do so much to conceal.

*Her Aunt had come by prior to the visitation to bring a scarf. As she cried she asked I only use this if absolutely necessary. She said, ""My niece hung herself with a scarf"".*

Those words still haunt me.

When it comes to cremation, the last thing you want to do is misidentify a body, so once the deceased arrives at the crematory, a unique number is assigned. These numbers are etched onto metal medallions with a hole and attached to steel wire about 10"" long; hard to miss in a collection of ash and bone when armed with a heavy-duty magnet.

The chapel I worked at had three levels, the crematory, of course, was in the basement and I was working alone.

I remember prepping her for cremation, getting the documentation aligned, and ***ensuring*** her assigned tag was with her.

She was lifted, the doors opened, and I gently pushed her in.

It can take from 1 to 4+ hours to cremate an individual. The longer hindered by whether or not they were cremated in a casket; she was not.

Following the cremation, her remains were cooled and then relocated to an enclosed (yet small) platform to ensure all metal objects were removed before processing.

It only took about twenty seconds before the panic sunk in. I couldn't find it, her tag was missing. I lifted every bone by hand and gingerly sifted through her remains, I re-swept the chamber and looked high and low in the area to no avail.

There was nothing left to do but bite the bullet and call management; losing one of these tags is a huge disservice to the process of something so sensitive and I felt sick.

I went for my cell phone which was on the table beside her remains; it caught my eyes, sharply.

Laying flat on top of her remains was the 10"" tag. Not an overlap of bone or ash, nothing. It looked as though it was simply and carefully placed there.

To this day I think this young girl was toying with me, perhaps having a bit of fun before our connected time came to a close.

Either way, it was eerie and something I could never explain.",4,41.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11imdsz/something_happened_at_the_funeral_home/,False,2023-03-05 03:35:55,False,False,False,0.96,,,,
eclectic_boogaloo2,None,False,False,False,11im3y7,False,False,t3_11im3y7,Soldier’s Cap,"For much of my childhood, I had been extremely perceptive to the supernatural and paranormal, but had blocked it out for much of my adult life. It wasn’t until the pandemic and losing several people that were close to me, as well as working as a personal caregiver in an old haunted country home that I’ve been able to once more become more in tune and perceptive to the paranormal. I have a lot of memories that have subsequently been recovered and I’d like to start sharing them here. This is the first.

When I was around ten years old, I went to visit my grandparents in a town not far from my home. They had bought their house from my grandmother’s parents in the 1950s and had remodeled or built several additions since the house was first built in the 1920s. Something about the old black and white photos on the wall always gave me the feeling that these relatives were still looking on and I often raced past the hallway where there pictures were adorned.

My grandfather had been a soldier in the 50s, having seen combat overseas, but didn’t talk about it often. He had lost several close friends in his unit and occasionally while he was telling a story about one of them, he would try to recall what happened to them before going into gruesome details about their end before almost laughing it off and changing the subject.

He was a small town boy who was born and died in the same town he lived for his whole life except for those few years away in the service. It wasn’t until his final years that he started openly sharing his own paranormal experiences with my grandmother and my father who were taking care of him. It’s not a subject they like to discuss much either, but my scientific and skeptical father has told me a few of my grandfather’s stories that stuck with him.

Back to my story. When I was ten years old, I asked my grandfather if he could show me his military uniform and other mementos from his time in the service. Excitable, he led me and my old sister just around the corner from the living room into his room. Pulling out old suitcases from his closet, he started to tell us a little background before handing us the items that we would try on or run out to the living room to share with our parents. 

While opening up a box containing side caps, he explained that they had one for each cardinal direction they were stationed in. However, after going through the box, he noticed there were five instead of four. Puzzled, he couldn’t recall how he had come in possession of an extra one in a different size. Naturally, I had asked if I could have it and he agreed.

When we got home that night, I put the cap on a shelf in my closet and forgot about it. Our house was built in the 90s on land that had real no historical significance, so I didn’t often think about the paranormal.

The next few nights, I noticed my closet door had been opened slightly after I would wake up. My closet was messy, I had a rack on the back that I would hang clothes from and not think much about it. My closet was also in the corner of the room, opposite from my bedroom windows, so light didn’t travel over there. I would shut it before bed, but I would glance over at it to see if I could spot it moving in the night. 

One night I had woke up and my closet door was open. I looked over and I could see a faint light just outside the door, not from the window and not from inside the closet. I started to focus on it and I could see from the light what appeared to be a thin young man figure in light khaki just standing there almost three quarters in profile just faintly turning his head looking into my closet. Terrified, I just closed my eyes, went under the covers and tried to go back to sleep.

This happened a few more nights, but as a non religious family, I didn’t know what to do. I was too afraid to ask my family as my mom was easily frightened by the supernatural, my father was skeptical and my sister would just make it worse.

Eventually, one night when I woke up and saw the figure standing there at the edge of my messy closet just peering around, I leaped out of bed and raced to turn on my overhead bedroom light on. When I looked back, he was gone, but I worked up the courage to go to my closet and turn the light on. I quickly searched for the hat and put it into a box. Exasperated, I said something along the lines of, “I’m sorry, I don’t know who you are, but be free. This is my house and my grandpa gave me that hat!”

I never saw him again and I wish I would have asked my grandpa about it, but I just imagine it was one of his old friends just looking for a lost cap.",1,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11im3y7/soldiers_cap/,False,2023-03-05 03:22:52,False,False,False,1.0,,,,
HowsMyDancing,None,False,False,False,11iglao,False,False,t3_11iglao,My stuff moved in my sleep and apparently no one did it,"Stuff moved in my sleep and this was never explained.

I’ll keep it simple. My sisters bed is next to my bed. So close I use it like a nightstand. I put my clothes for tomorrow and my glasses on that bed before I went to sleep. The glasses were at one end of the bed while I was on the other and the clothes were on the same end.

I woke up at like 2am for some reason and started playing a game on my iPad when I was going to go to the bathroom. I went to reach for my glasses only to see they were gone and my clothes were messed up on the side of the bed close to me in front of my face. 

I initially thought my sister just moved my things so I was just annoyed at first and started looking for my glasses and while doing that it made less and less sense to me that this was the case because my sister didn’t live there and she didn’t have keys to the house. When I did find my glasses the were at the foot of my bed with my chargers.

I put them on and this is when I really took in the situation. I went to the bathroom very confused and kind of creeped out but my grandma lives with me so I just tried to stay calm and ask her in the morning. 

In the morning when I asked she said she didn’t move my stuff and never got up last night. She said I probably sleep walked but that just doesn’t seem right to me because I’ve never sleepwalked before and I’m not at the age where it just starts happening as a teenager. 

When I’m stressed I can experience insomnia and exhaustion which triggers episodes of sleep paralysis but no one’s ever told me I sleepwalk and I’m not a particularly heavy sleeper.

Plus the way I tuck my feet when I got to sleep under my sheets was the same when I woke up and I don’t know much about sleep walking but I thought it’s simple motions and repeated behavior. It’s a nonsensical pattern yes,but it’s almost too perfect.

It’s my conclusion that it was my grandmother but I just don’t see that either cause she doesn’t sleepwalk either.

Back when I was 7 years old, my father passed away in a car accident. At that age I didn’t know how to handle it or what to do. I was raised Catholic and attended CCD so I decided: why not try praying?

I wanted to make sure he was still carrying on and that he wasn’t just “gone”. So I started praying like they taught me in CCD (again I’m only 7/8 years old) and ask for him to show me a sign he’s still there. This is something I had regret at the time, but thankful later I had the experience of doing this.

For the next year or so, I was woken up in the middle of the night on several occasions. The first time, he walked into my room and stood next to my bed. I heard the door creak open (which is when I woke up) and then his heavy boots (he was a car mechanic) started walking towards my bed. I was scared SH*TLESS. I started sweating, squeezing my blankets as I faced the wall. I remained awake and scared until he left. 

Another situation I was awaken from coins being bounced off of my bureau. That happened a few times where things were gently being slid off the top of it. Aside from a handful of other dreams I had where he visited me, it got to a point where my foot/leg was being poked in the middle of the night which was when I decided to pray and ask him to stop. 

I was incredibly relieved to know he was still there, and it all stopped when I prayed again asking him to. I have some other instances with a medium and how I knew he was/is watching over me.

thatonebountygirl,None,False,False,False,11gly5u,False,False,t3_11gly5u,Son talking to ‘someone’,"Hi everyone, 

First time posting, long time lurker. My 2 year old son had a stomach bug last weekend, so to keep an eye on him after he went to bed, I had plugged in the video baby monitor to make sure he wasn’t throwing up etc..  Around 11:45pm I noticed the screen light up (which it does whenever it detects sound) and he was seemingly sleep-talking at first, so I listened in and it was usual baby gibberish. About 5 minutes later, he had his eyes open and was talking to ‘someone’. He was looking straight up and pointing to the direction that he was talking to. He kept saying “go to sleep”. As he’s only 2, I couldn’t make out everything he was saying but a few words here and there. I swore I could hear a man’s voice but I put it down to being nearly midnight and I was tired, plus my partner (his dad) was getting ready for bed in the room with me. 

Fast forward to the next morning, for some reason I thought I would try something. My Grandpa died 5 years ago, obviously before my son was born and I was close with him but I have never shown a photo to my son before. So I found a picture of my grandfather and asked my son who it was, he replied “Grandpa”, I thought I misheard so I asked again, same answer. I said “where is he?” My son replied “upstairs”. I took him upstairs and asked where he was again, he then pointed into his room and said “he’s gone”. 

I cried, I think happy tears though. It’s nice to know my Grandpa is still around and though he never met my son (and now daughter aswell) that he’s watching over them.

Pretend_Book_4351,None,False,False,True,11haezt,False,False,t3_11haezt,Sleeping with my eyes open,"So, around 11am today I fell back asleep after doing some stuff I needed done, mind u I work until 330am. Anyways, I fell asleep in the basement of my house where it's completely dark and where I sometimes light a candle and incense. Well I had the candle accidentally lit all night the day before and blew it out when I got home the following morning(today) so I wouldn't forget again.. Well when I fell back asleep it was with my eyes open and I could see the flame flickering on the ceiling. And I remember having a quick thought of why did my brother light that candle he doesn't like them, so I realized then that I was asleep with my eyes open bc I went to call for him as he was sitting on the futon across the room from me. But i couldn't speak or move, so I started whimpering, to get his attention to wake me up l. Because I'd already told him it happens to me and to wake me up if he hears me making the whimpering sounds again. Well he looks over at me and gets up and walks over to me. Mind you the only light is from the candle and the tiniest bit of light to the right of my bed from all the way up an l shaped staircase blocked by a wall to the ceiling. So he comes over to my right side and I'm laying slightly turned left and can only move my eyes and no more than 2 or 3 inches with my hand. I try to reach up to him but fail and he's like ""grab my hand"", I whimper, and he keeps saying grab my hand 2 or 3 more times while barely in reach of my own hand, I just couldn't make the couple more inches to grab it. At that point I'm freaking out trying to wake myself up and he goes over to the futon and comes back with this blue, what looks like a blue eyeglass cleaner rag, and comes back and hangs it over me for like 3 secs throws it on the ground beside my bed...and then he knees down right behind and to the right of the bed right out of my line of sight. I finally move myself enough to wake up and sit up a little on my elbow, and I turn and look to my right and was like ""landon why the fuck didn't you grab my hand"" he didn't answer, it scared me a little so I was like ""landon"" no answer. Again mind you this distance between me him and the light behind the silhouette or brother was less than 3 feet, and the light switch is right above my bed frame. I reached up and hit switch and the silhouette of my brother disappeared.

Senior_Sense_8813,None,False,False,False,11g6byy,False,False,t3_11g6byy,I think I’ve been possessed or haunted.,"So to start at the time I was around 11-12.  I’m a person who loves mystery’s and documentaries type of stuff. I loved learning about spiritual things. I would watch this one YouTuber I think the name was top 5 (I’m not too sure), but he would talk about things like “top 5 scariest things caught on camera”.  

He would post daily and I would watch his videos every singe day. I would spend hours at a time watching those videos and never get scared or frightened in any way, but one day as I was watching one of his videos I start to get this eerie feeling. I start to feel off and unreal. I then go through a dissociative episode. It feels like I have to puke and I can’t recognize myself. I shut my computer and start to flip. 

I was terrified to turn my computer on again after that. Until a few weeks later I wanted to watch YouTube on my computer+ it was my only device at the time. I turned my computer on and went to YouTube, and since I always watched the scary mystery videos my recommended was all filled up with them. As soon as I seen it I immediately froze. It felt like I wasn’t here and I was terrified . 

I got a sense of deja vu and pure terror and panic. I felt every emotion in my body and was uncomfortable. Once I snapped back I shut my computer and was overwhelmed. I went to my mom crying and told her I was afraid. I was shaking and couldn’t breath straight. I was extremely paranoid after that. Something that day changed me. Now years later I still can’t pull myself to watch those type of videos. Some of the fear has worn off but I’m still worried that what happend will happen again. 

I still don’t know why I reacted the way I did , and if anyone knows anything please comment.",4,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11g6byy/i_think_ive_been_possessed_or_haunted/,False,2023-03-02 16:01:35,False,False,False,0.8,,,,
Marqoroboto,None,False,False,False,11g0mpb,False,False,t3_11g0mpb,Did I hear a ghost?,"So this just happened not more than an hour ago, so I’m gonna write this out while it’s still fresh.

About 3 weeks and 1 day ago, there was a suicide at my uni campus, apparently they had jumped from the top floor to the “basement area” (a lower part of the building that’s open air). Now, I had already woken up that day feeling dread in the air, ever since I was little I’ve felt as if I was connected to spirits and ghosts more than others, but I digress, that’s a story for another time.

Anyways, last night (or the past 3 hours or so), I decided that I would take some pics of campus when it was dark out, I’m not sure why, but I couldn’t (and still can’t) sleep so I figured might as well take some creepy or liminal pics. So I went out and took the pictures, then I decided to go to this building where the incident happened. 

As soon as I went down the stairs to the lower area I immediately felt unsafe and as if I was being watched. Something definitely felt off, so I tried to take some quick shots and just get out. I took about 4 pictures on the leftmost side of the area then moved to the center part. As soon as I raise my phone to take the picture, I hear something behind me which sounded like a rustling or small crack. I pause and to try and filter the sound out by just not acknowledging it. Not one second later I hear a tremendous and loud CRUNCH from my left/behind me. I’ve never been so frozen in fear in my life. I don’t even think and I start walking to the right as there were stairs there too. I quickly ran up those stairs then looked back debating with myself if I should check it out or not. I decided to briefly investigate so I went near where I thought the sound came from, peered over the railing and saw nothing. 

Im back in my dorm now, and out of morbid curiosity I researched what a body sounds like when it hits the ground. Lo and behold, a loud crunching/popping sound.

So yeah…. 
Im not getting any sleep tonight and I will definitely never go back to anywhere near that building. What do y’all think it was?",4,20.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11g0mpb/did_i_hear_a_ghost/,False,2023-03-02 11:38:10,False,False,False,0.83,,,,

The first was one day after school, my brother had just got in trouble from my mother, I don't remember the reason why. She was talking with him about why he got in trouble when he said it wasn't him. She then asked who did it then and my brother replied ""him"" and looked up at the vent that was above us in the living room. Whether this was just him not wanting to be punished or actually something scared me. This would happen for a few months after any time he was in trouble. The second occurrence needs some knowledge to understand. My grandfather had pasted away about 2 years before my brother was born so my brother had never met him. My grandfather was a goofball and to get me to laugh as a kid would do an elephant noise also moving his arm like a trunk. I found that so cool and would imitate him. One day my family was showing my brother a picture of my grandfather. We told him that it was his moms dad. He then pointed right at the photo and made a trunk with his hands and attempted at making an elephant noise. My family and I all looked at each other in amazement about what had happened.

Debthewolf,None,False,False,False,11fgvqi,False,False,t3_11fgvqi,Dead Grandpa Came to Meet His Beloved,"  When my grandma was on her deathbed, I stayed at her house to watch over her during her final days. I am pretty sure the stories I’m about to tell were from my grandpa’s ghost coming to meet her at the gates. 

Note that her house had shag carpets- meaning it took some force to open or close one of the inside doors. There is no way a breeze could move these doors. 

A couple of days before her death, I was in the basement hanging out. The bathroom door swung open on its own. I said out loud, “Grandpa if that’s you, please don’t spook me! I’m afraid of ghosts!”

The day before she passed, grandma was bedridden. She hated having her bedroom door closed, but I didn’t want to wake her while doing chores so I closed it for a few minutes while she napped. After I vacuumed, I went to check on grandma and her door was open. 

I closed it again so as not to wake her as I did the dishes. Once the dishes were washed, I went to check on her again and the door had opened once more. 

On one of those last days, grandma spoke about seeing family members that passed before her, including my grandpa.

BellaDancerella,None,False,False,False,11fszmh,False,False,t3_11fszmh,As a Child,"I feel a little naive posting this, but I swear on everything I have that these experiences were real. I have read in numerous sources that’s ghosts/poltergeists are often attracted to interact with children for some reason on another.
Anyways, I’ll get to the stories…
In about 4th or 5th grade, my friend and I, who I will call Jade, were obsessed with ghost stories and anything paranormal. For months and years on end we would try to contact the dead every time we hung out, despite our parents forbidding it. There are a few instances which I still remember so so vividly, when I think about them when I’m alone, I still get uneasy feelings.
Jade and I tried for weeks to get someone or something to show themselves. One night, we stayed up late to do this and we ended up being successful. We turned the lights off and had a few candles lit so we were still able to see each other. We made a circle out of socks and sat in the middle of it with bowls of salt for ‘protection’. We asked and asked for something to show itself. Jade had many posters on her walls, and that is how it chose to show itself. There was a poster with dogs on it behind us, and whatever was in the room with us slapped the poster on the wall so hard. It was like if you had a normal piece of paper and you slapped it from the air down onto a table. The sound is so distinct. We freaked out, especially when her parents came in and told us not to bang on the walls, and we tried to tell them it wasn’t us and they didn’t believe us. We ended up not sleeping in her room that night, and not long after that incident— Jade had a phobia of any of her stuffed animals ‘looking at her’ while she slept, so she would always face them toward the wall before bed, and this one teddy bear would always be turned back ‘watching her’ after that. 
At my own house, there was probably a year straight where I would hear activity in my room, when I was about 11 or 12. I would try to fall asleep at night and the sound of whispering would keep me up. It was like whispering voices all layered on top of each other and it was so overwhelming. I could hear my toys move in the middle of the night but I was never brave enough to peek my head out from under the covers. I had always sleep walked, and I still do, but during this year, my sleepwalking was at an all time high and my parents would find me in random places in the house talking to myself in the middle of the night. 
There was one night which especially haunts me to this day. I had the flu when I was 13 or 14 years old and I was really sick and had problems sleeping. I always slept with a night light on, so my room was dim and shadowy. I laid there on my back with my eyes open, unable to fall asleep. That layered whispering stuff started again for the first time in years. Along with the whispering, these huge shadows on all walls in my room slowly creeped up my walls. I remember laying there sweating unable to move because I was terrified. They slowly moved up my walls for about a minute until they reached my ceiling and caved in on top of me— pitch black. It was suffocating and debilitating and I still freak out thinking about it. The visuals are still so clear in my head. Anybody can explain this as a fever dream, but I swear I DID NOT fall asleep. I could NOT sleep. I believe I had an outer body experience because I saw this from the position of the corner of my room. I don’t know how to explain this, but I know in my heart I was NOT asleep.

Why have I not experienced anything else since I was a teenager?",5,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11fszmh/as_a_child/,False,2023-03-02 04:33:31,False,False,False,1.0,,,,
__ladymoody,None,False,False,False,11f4vga,False,False,t3_11f4vga,Our apartment in the 11th floor,"**(English is not my first language or even the second so I'm sorry if the narration is odd or if there's any grammatical mistakes, also this story might sound poetic at some point and somewhat unbelievable but everything is real from the way I felt to what I'v seen, at least to me)** 

I always considered that I've had a normal life, I mean as normal as it can be in a North African country. at home religion was never forced on me and my siblings or any beliefs in occult things even tho in my country it's a a pretty believed thing. 

today I'm here to share my story, I don't like to refer to it as a ghost story because I don't think what I was exposed to was a ghost. But what I know for sure is that it lived with us because of the constant feeling of being watched, the voices and the multiple times I hade a clear look on this ""entity""

the first time I remember seeing it was at 13 years old, coming back from school to have lunch in our apartment in the 11th floor I saw from afar my mom in the balcony, I thought it was weird to see her at that time of the day because she works but I was just happy she was home.  In front of the door I found myself knocking multiple times but mom never opened so I ended up opening it with my key assuming that my mom is still in the balcony and just didn't hear me, just to find myself in an empty apartment. after inspecting the balcony and the apartment mom was no where to be seen. Well even at a young age I was a very logical person so I assumed again, it's the 11th floor it takes a bit of time to reach it maybe while I was in the elevator she took the stairs to go buy something?.  while having this thought the house phone was ringing, i answered and it was mom asking if I got home and that she will probably be late today because there a lot of work.

the second time was maybe 2 years after the first time, in my brother's room. I always loved that room because my brother had the ps3 which was wild at that time and I loved playing video game, so any time my brother wasn't spending the night at home his room become mine. after playing video games till very late ate night I end up sleeping at 3am just to wake up at 5, I new the time because when I opened my eyes I could hear the first adhan ( the islamic call for the prayer) of the day outside. it was still pretty dark but I saw mom going around home making a little bit of noise, it wasn't weird at all since she usually wake up early to prepare our lunch in advance so I got back to my sleeping, only to wake up hours later and noticing that it was actually the week-end, mom never wake up early when it's the week-end so I asked her why she woke up so early she looked at me and said ""I didn't, I slept till 10am"" 

the third time was life saving, everyone was sleeping, I woke up at night to my mom's voice telling me that something is weird I should wake up and smell because it smells bad, so I woke up to an apartment smelling awful and I new that smell, it was gas. 

I hear about families sleeping and never waking up again because of a gas leak.

I was sure about one thing this entity or whatever it's called that looks like my mom and sounded like her didn't want anything bad to happen to us (me?) , but it didn't want us to move from that apartment cause well it was so hard to move out from that place, every time we would find someone to buy it that person would just stop answering the phone, every time we talk about moving out my parents end up having a fight over ridiculous reasons.

these are the times that marked me the most, but I've felt presence multiple times, I hear voices multiple times (even stories I was too young to remember from my parents making fun of me having an imaginary friend ), but I never mentioned how I felt after these encounters ,terrified? never, I never felt a single negative emotion, I was never terrified from it I never talked about how I felt when I saw it or heard it because at that time I never thought much about it never even mention it to anyone, I have no idea how my brain was functioning at that time, sometimes I ask myself maybe it did something with my feelings so could never fear it ?

What I know now is that that apartment was the only place that felt like home, from the day I left it I felt like I've lost something and still feel like something is missing, when everyone is in a family gathering I always find myself waiting for someone to come even when ""everyone"" is here.

if I had the money I think I would buy that apartment again, maybe what I've lost is still there?",1,16.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11f4vga/our_apartment_in_the_11th_floor/,False,2023-03-01 14:16:29,False,False,False,0.94,,,,

WitchNode,None,False,False,True,11duaua,False,False,t3_11duaua,My home is Haunted,"I purchased my home a little over a year ago. My girlfriend and I started noticing things from the beginning. We would always find a way to explain the phenomenon. The woman's voice my girlfriend heard while we were painting upstairs, we figured it must have come from someone outside. The constant light slamming of my laundry chute, we figured it must have something to do with the air pressure or some kind of draft. One night we were awoken by a very loud bang on our bedroom door as if somebody had thrown their body into it. My girlfriend was frozen with fear, thinking somebody was in the house I quickly grabbed my pistol and swept each room, but nothing was there, maybe it was just a loud cracking sound houses make? Another night I was woken up by the feeling of something pushing on the end of the bed next to my feet. In a sleepy haze, I thought it was my cat jumping on the bed, but it quickly hit me that my cat does not stay in my room at night. I wiggled my feet and whatever was pushing down stopped. I wrote it off. The whistling, the sound of a bell, the sound of something dropping, and the shadow moving across the hallway wall, are all things I've explained away. But the other night was the last straw and I am now convinced something is haunting my home. I came from work at 11 pm, 11:30 I shut all the lights off, walk upstairs, and as soon as I get to the top of the stairs feel a breeze of air coming up the stairway and I hear a man's voice talking. I could not make out what was being said, but it was as clear as day, somebody was talking from what sounded like my kitchen or near it in the living room. It lasted for a few seconds. I get chills thinking about it. It seems every day since something new has happened. Tupperware flying out from our cabinet, not dropping, flying onto the floor. A lot of activity from the kitchen.

Tasty_Doughnut2493,None,False,False,True,11d2nya,False,False,t3_11d2nya,Touched at the Denham Inn,"This is a long one. Sorry. When I was younger, my mom and I loved to travel to haunted locations in the region. One place we found ourselves at one summer was The Denham Inn in Monticello, FL. Our room was on the second floor - second on the right. It faced out to the front yard.  It was the height of summer, and the AC was not strong on the second floor. 

We settled in for the night. We decided to share the Queen bed rather than mess up the daybed across the room as well. Due to the heat, the fan was going, and we kicked the heavy comforter off the bed right away and only slept with a thin sheet covering us. I wore only a long, baggy t-shirt and underwear to sleep. By the next morning, my only limb fully covered by the thin sheet was my right leg. 

Around 6 that morning (checked later), I felt a hesitant and gentle touch slide up from my inside left ankle to the inside of my left knee. Half asleep - half awake, I simply kicked my foot. Little bit later same touch but now it's starting on the inside of my left wrist and moves to the inside of my left elbow. Same reaction except now I mutter, “Stop.”

Little while later same touch EXCEPT right inside elbow down to right inside wrist. Slightly stronger reaction - shook my arm and said louder, “Stop!” Little while later, I felt the the touch on my inside right knee. Problem - it was under the covers. 

At this moment, I sat up in bed loudly saying, “Stop touching me! Just stop touching me!”. My mom woke up asking me what was wrong. My response? “Mama, something keeps touching me, and won’t leave me alone.”. We looked throughout the room. No mosquitoes, flies, or even loose threads on the sheets. Nothing should’ve or could’ve caused a distinct touching pattern like that.

That morning, at breakfast, we mentioned to the owner that we believe I was touched. Without  any details, she asked, “Was an arm or leg out of the blankets?”  

Me: “Uhhhh yes.”

Her: “What room again?” I told her our room name. It was by far not “THE” haunted room. She just nodded her head and responded. “That's Aunt Sarah.” 

I had already heard about Aunt Sarah (daughter of the original builder and last living inhabitant of their family in the house), but I wasn't in her room or space, so she never crossed my mind.

Once again, the owner said, “It's Aunt Sarah. She likes to tuck people in, so any time an arm or leg is exposed she ‘tucks’ it in. I’ve also been getting more reports out of that room lately with Aunt Sarah than any other. The other room’s been fairly quiet. We’ve heard a good but out of that room though. Do you mind if I share your story?”

Me: “Ummmmmmm, no. Go ahead.”  we still had another night to stay but nothing happened. Needless to say, I didn't sleep well, and all my limbs stayed covered.

I’m a southerner by life, heart, and family. I’ve never woken up because of a mosquito tracing lines down my arms and legs. I sleep with fans more often than not. I’ve never felt that from an overhead fan before. I will forever believe something or someone touched me.

sansthetherian,None,False,False,False,11co9g3,False,False,t3_11co9g3,My Old Haunted Apartment,"So for context, this happened when I was little, maybe somewhere between six to eight years ago. At the time I lived in this old apartment complex, I believe it was about 50 years old at that point. A lot of things went down in that apartment, and the paranormal experiences had begun before I was even born.

So one day, me, my mom, and my nana were all in the kitchen. I was eating breakfast, and I think my nana was doing the dishes. I don't remember what my mom was doing. We were all talking and laughing like an actual family for once, when my mom suddenly told us to stop. She walked up beside me and got really close, before pointing up to the ceiling and whispering, ""listen"". In the upstairs room right above us, which was the room me and my mother were sharing at the time, you could hear footsteps walking across the room. Keep in mind, we were the only people in the apartment at the time. Looking back on it, it scares me, but at the time, I found it exciting and thrilling. I knew it couldn't have just been the house setting because it was actually moving across the room. 

Even though we moved out of that apartment three or four years ago at this point, it hasn't stopped.",1,24.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11co9g3/my_old_haunted_apartment/,False,2023-02-26 18:11:00,False,False,False,0.9,,,,
FangioGP,None,False,False,False,11c3fsc,False,False,t3_11c3fsc,My Best Friend Was Murdered by Her Ex-Boyfriend. She Still Answers Her Phone.,"So, my neighbor, Lynn, who was also my best friend, was murdered by her ex-boyfriend on the sidewalk in front of her house. I guess maybe because she was my best friend, I couldn't make myself delete her number from the contacts list on my phone, even after a year had passed. Every so often, when I deleted people I no longer wanted to hear from, or no longer needed to call, or couldn't remember who they were, I would think about deleting it, but I could never go through with it. I don't know, the idea of ""deleting"" her just seemed like too much.

So one day I scrolled past her name looking for somebody else's number and wondered what would happen if I called her. The phone rang twice, and she answered. I thought I was going to faint from the adrenaline shot that exploded inside my head. I said, ""Lynnie, is that you?"" She said, ""Hello?"" and I said, ""Lynnie, can you hear me?"" She said, ""Hello,"" again and I said, ""Hey, Lynnie, it's me."" Then she hung up. I thought about calling our other friends and telling them, but I realized how crazy I would sound, and how much I might upset everybody, so I didn't.

The next day I called the number again and she answered again, and once again she couldn't hear me. I called her eight or ten times over the next few days before she finally stopped answering the phone. I kept calling--I'm not proud of it, but there you go--even though the calls went straight to voice mail. I would've left a message, but the box was full. I tried texting, but she didn't respond. I finally decided, OK just one more time, and this time she answered. She said, ""I don't know who you are, but please stop. You're scaring me.""

I felt like the biggest jerk in the world. I mean, in her last minute alive she had been afraid--of a man who wouldn't stop calling her. And I certainly didn't want to be the guy that frightened her after she was dead. That breaks my heart to even think about. I wished I could've apologized, but that would've meant dialing that number. I didn't call her again, I stopped texting, but I also didn't delete her contact. I just couldn't and still can't. 

A month or so later, when our friend Betsy mentioned Lynn one night at dinner, I asked her if she still had Lynn's number on her phone. She did. I said, ""I wonder what would happen if you called it?"" She pulled out her phone and called. She listened for a minute and then and shrugged. ""It's been disconnected,"" she said. ""What did you think was going to happen?"" I kind of halfway laughed and said, ""I was hoping she would answer."" Betsy said, ""I get that, but, seriously, that's a little messed up,"" and that was the last time we talked about it. I haven't tried to call Lynn again, because I don't want to scare her, but I still wish she would call me.",25,169.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11c3fsc/my_best_friend_was_murdered_by_her_exboyfriend/,False,2023-02-26 02:50:25,False,False,False,0.87,,,,
BusyBizBusyBiz,None,False,False,True,11c0gon,False,False,t3_11c0gon,"Hesitant to start questioning this, but I think there's some entity in my apartment.","I live in a ""trendy"" downtown loft apartment inside a 100yr+ old building. It used to be a clothing factory in the late 1800's, into the 1950's. This is a short story, but I recently moved in and one morning the entire left side of the kitchen sink was filled with coffee mugs. They were neatly placed. My girlfriend didn't have an explanation and neither did I, although I postulated that I may have been sleep walking, which I haven't done since I was a small child so not likely. The mugs did not need to be cleaned, since we just moved and all the dishes were clean.

It's just weird. My girlfriend and I haven't talked about it since but I honestly feel like we just want to avoid the subject. What do you think?

[Edit - I added this in the comments but figured I would add this to the post for visibility] :

There a little more to this. When I was putting dishes away on move-in week, a shelf collapsed and all the glass came avalanching onto my head and shoulders - thankfully I was wearing a ball cap and a hoodie so I was not injured, we just had a big mess to cleanup. The shelf appeared sturdy as I was loading it up, and i don't understand how it broke. 

Two more things.

While sitting in my office, I heard my girlfriend say ""pssst"" to get my attention. I went over to her and said it back, asking way she wanted to show me. She claims she didn't say anything.

Finegling,None,False,False,False,11bwurn,False,False,t3_11bwurn,Early 90’s Nightclub Poltergeist,"During the school summer holidays, my twin and I would be taken into my mothers work, who at the time was a secretary for a nightclub which operated in an old regency pier building, in Southampton in the UK.
As kids my brother and I were obsessed with ghosts, we still are now.
What we experienced one day would cement this interest, we still talk about it now.
We used to run around this old building, and one day one of the members of staff there told us that the cleaning staff refused to come in when it was dark - they claim they saw a misty figure and a feeling of being intensely watched.
The chef told us that he sometimes came in early to start the food prep, and find all the cupboards open, all the pots and pans laid out in lines on the floor. The alarms never tripped, the cameras in the bar seeing nothing.
Well this was music to our ears, and the first thing we do is visit the kitchen, and ask “if anyone is in here show yourself”.
With that, some eggs on the side of the counter flew across the room and smashed. 
We barrel it out of there, and when I mean run we were absolutely out of there in a flash.
We run to our mum, white as a sheet, and explain what happened. The adults there say maybe a lorry went by, and the vibrations knocked it off (absolutely not).

The place was closed for ages. It reopened as a Thai restaurant and I got to go to the opening night through some weird coincidence. 

As soon as I passed that kitchen again for the first time in 15 years I felt a cold finger down my back and that feeling of being watched.

Senator_Sin_Eater,None,False,False,False,11bsn5f,False,False,t3_11bsn5f,Anyone here heard of Boston's Omni Parker House?,"Not only is it the longest continuously-running hotel in the United States, but staff and clients have reported hauntings and paranormal activity repeatedly over the past 100+ years (even in the Boston Globe on numerous occasions). Part of this is likely because it's across the street from the King's Chapel Burying Ground and the Granary Burying Ground, in which the bodies of various members of the Court of Oyer and Terminer—the judicial body that oversaw the Salem Witchcraft Trials—and even a few accused witches are interred. Full disclosure: I once took a photo of the table-top tombstone of Wait Still Winthrop's grave in the King's Chapel Burying Ground and had what I'd describe as an ""uncanny"" experience. The light dimmed inexplicably at the moment I went to photograph it, and a blue orb appeared in the photo. Very well could just be a light anomaly, but...

More on the Parker House—in the 1850s, the Parker House Restaurant was the clubhouse for the fraternal Saturday Club, which included many prominent Massachusetts intellectuals, Transcendentalists, Fireside Poets, Boston Brahmins, and future diplomats (Emerson, Longfellow, Lowell, etc). The Parker House's history also intersects with numerous assassinations (presidential & otherwise)... John Wilkes Booth stayed there while visiting his brother Edwin Booth (a fellow Freemason and actor) 8 days prior to assassinating Lincoln, and even practiced his aim at a shooting gallery behind it. This fact is especially illuminating, as the Parker House was also the favorite hangout of the Boston Brahmin elite—many of whom were Cotton Whigs, and who had funded and propped up various secessionist movements and filibustering campaigns in the decades preceding the Civil War through Scottish Rite Freemasonry and the Knights of the Golden Circle. In the 20th Century, JFK would deliver his first public speech as a little boy in the Parker House, host his bachelor party in its press room, and even announce his candidacy for US House of Rep there following WWII. Another assassinated individual who spent considerable time in the Parker? Malcolm X worked there as a bus boy during his Boston years prior to joining Elijah Muhammad's Nation of Islam. Oh, and Ho Chi Minh worked there as a baker from 1911-1913, years prior to becoming the leader of the anti-colonial movement in Vietnam.

ouidkillA,None,False,False,True,11bdyg3,False,False,t3_11bdyg3,My partner’s niece wanted me to share her three experiences she had in her home where a man died.,"So, as it says, my partners niece wanted to share some experiences she had. I’ll preface this by saying that she is a very logical and smart kid. She’s fifteen, and doesn’t lie about these kinds of things. (I could tell if she was because she’s an awful liar).

Anyways, her family moved into an old house in which an elderly man passed. He died in the room her younger brother moved into. They also found a grave in their backyard for a man who passed in the late 1800s. 

One night, my partners niece was laying in her bed, back to her open door. A lamp in the hallway was casting a little bit of light into her room. She rolled over at one point and thought she saw a black, shadowy figure standing in the room, just past the door where the light vaguely reached. She said in her half-wake, she managed to convince herself that maybe it was just a family member grabbing something and went to sleep. It wasn’t until the next morning that she thought about it more clearly and realized how weird it was, and she’s convinced it wasn’t just a dream. 

The next incident occurred during the daytime. She and her brother were sitting in the living room watching tv when their dog started aggressively barking into her brothers room. The two were terrified to the point that they were too scared to get up and investigate, and the dog kept barking for several minutes. But then it scrambled back a couple of steps and followed something with its gaze that seemed to walk across the hall and into the niece’s room. It continued for a couple minutes and then the dog just kind of stopped as suddenly as it started. 

And the third one legitimately makes my skin crawl. Her stepdad is a firm non-believer. One day, he came to them seeming shaken up and told them he had a dream where he saw a black figure standing in his doorway. He recalled telling the thing to go away. A few nights later, he dreamt it again, but this time it stood at the foot of the bed. He just kept telling it to go away and that it didn’t belong there. He dreamt of it just one more time and this time it was standing over  him. SO’s niece says he looked really freaked out over it. 

There were some other weird things like her brother sleepwalking and staring out his window while sleepwalking. She’s talked about these incidents many times and always been very consistent. She always wanted to know if anyone has experienced anything similar.",12,49.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11bdyg3/my_partners_niece_wanted_me_to_share_her_three/,False,2023-02-25 06:20:27,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

I can’t risk anyone identifying the location or guessing the people associated with the story.

My boss called me yesterday afternoon while I was driving home. He said that he had to tell me about something weird that happened at a job site.

Background: We had installed some network equipment at a big house. When I was there I got a really strange feeling. It was an older house that seemed overdue for updates. It also seemed a bit neglected. I was unsettled and confused. I just couldn’t put my finger on the reasons why.

I later found out that something bad happened there. Something very bad, tragic, and heartbreaking. That is as specific as I can be.

The day before yesterday we got an automated monitoring alert that a piece of equipment we installed had failed. Our guess was that it had overheated or that it got wet and shorted out. It was all brand new, so we assumed that the cause of the failure was environmental somehow. 

I was busy elsewhere, so my boss got there about a day after it had failed. He found that the equipment was fine, but that it was simply powered off. It was attached to a power distribution unit (PDU). The PDU is connected to the network and has power outlets that can be remotely controlled. This is commonly used so that if a piece of equipment is malfunctioning, it can be rebooted remotely, which often resolves the problem. 

This particular piece of equipment was connected to a “power-cycle only” power outlet on the PDU , meaning that the power outlet does not ever stay powered off, but will only “blink” the power off briefly before resuming normal operation. The device wasn’t working because the power outlet that it was connected to had turned off, which it shouldn’t ever do if the PDU was working correctly.

My boss assumed that the PDU had somehow failed. He sat there staring at the PDU while contemplating his next course of action. While he was staring directly at it, the red LED on the PDU electrical outlet suddenly turned on. The connected equipment turned on and resumed normal operation. It had been powered off for a whole day and suddenly came back on by itself. While he was staring at it. 

He told the client what happened and said he had no explanation for it. He jokingly said “It’s haunted.”  The client accepted that calmly and said “That kind of thing happens here all the time.” 

The client had previously told us that the house makes them very uncomfortable and they don’t like being there.",2,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11bi1mv/electronic_anomaly_at_tragedy_house/,False,2023-02-25 10:39:00,False,False,False,0.79,,,,

ZestycloseRoyal7166,None,False,False,False,11auw6p,False,False,t3_11auw6p,My Neighbours’ Haunted Trailer,"This story happened to my neighbours. For context, my family lived on an acreage close to five minutes west of the small town of Consort in Alberta, Canada. Our neighbours lived in a mobile home on a farm just a few minutes north of us.

One night back in 1986, shortly after their oldest child was born, the family was sound asleep. The dad, let’s call him Todd, woke up, and looked over at the baby’s crib where he saw a shadow slowly creeping along the wall towards it. He assumed that it was just his wife…until he looked over to see that she was still asleep next to him. He quickly looked back at the shadow only to watching it disappear into the floor.

This wasn’t the first time Todd and his wife experienced something paranormal in that trailer. They told us stories of objects moving on their own, lights turning on and off, and most terrifying of all, having their blankets pulled off of them in the middle of the night. They never really knew who or what could’ve been haunting their mobile home, but it definitely didn’t seem very welcoming.

Years after the shadow-on-the-wall experience, the family would build a house on that same property. They continue to live in that house to this very day. Whenever my parents visited our neighbours, they would often drag me and my sister along with them. We’d play with our neighbours’ kids, often going into the old mobile home. While I never experienced anything in that trailer, my sister did say she heard doors closing by themselves, but thought it was just the wind. I can say, however, that the few times I was inside that building, I felt very uneasy.

So I saw on YouTube these people doing “3am challenges “ now obviously I know they’re not real but I was 11 and very impressionable. 

I decided it was a good idea to summon ghosts so i looked up some stuff on Google. I found some ritual (I honestly forgot what it was called) and I preformed it in my bathroom at night 


Ever since I’ve had multiple experiences with this “shadow person” and I decided not to get rid of it. Yes it is creepy but it’s never hurt me and I feel like if it wanted to it would’ve by now. 


Almost every night I hear banging on my back door that no one else can hear and at first I thought I was paranoid or just going crazy but as I got older I realized I have an ability. (I can sense,see , hear paranormal stuff) it runs in my family so I wasn’t surprised. My grandma has it and her grandma did as well. 


Now I hear it walking around my house a lot or trying to speak to me but it doesn’t really bother me anymore because I know it won’t hurt me.

As I was laying in bed I feel like something is staring at me but I tried to ignore it because I thought if I kept ignoring it then it would go away, but it didn't
I turn over so I'm facing my door and i open my eyes slightly and I see a dark figure poking its head through my slightly opened door. I was frozen. I couldn't move or say anything or make any noise. I was completely still. Like I couldn't control my own body it was terrible. Once the figure noticed I see it, it quickly slams the door after a few minutes I sit up and stay there. After a few more minutes I get up and slowly open the door. I don't see anything so I walk out farther. I hear someone walking, but not regularly but like in a circle. I go downstairs to tell my Dad what happened and then I feel something breathe down my back. I turn around and see a shadow slowly fading away. That was my sign to gtfo so I run down the stairs into my dads room.
He checks every door and window and there's no sign of entry. The house cameras were also checked. Nothing. To this day i don't know what or who that was.

From hearing their voices, to people seeing them all the way to levitating objects. The one thing I always notice is stories about super loud noises. 


I've noticed there's people who have talked about a noise so loud they run thinking the TV or something super heavy just fell, but they find nothing. All of these noises were heard where the person used to live and they're all unrelated stories (like my aunts from my mom's family told me they heard that when my grandma was delirious (few days away from dying), then my dad's mom said she heard that when my grandpa just passed away and a friend told me she heard that few days after her roommate died.

Alexa_488,None,False,False,False,119vlng,False,False,t3_119vlng,Encounter with some sort of spirit or creature I had as a child in a cemetery.,"
Hello my name is Alexa I’m 35 years old. I’ve always been sensitive to the paranormal and I’ve attracted things both human and nonhuman as long as I can remember I have many stories. This was not my first experience but this stands out to me because of how I felt. 

When I was a kid about 11 or 12 I used to walk to and from school and I would always take a shortcut through the local cemetery. One day after school I was talking my shortcut through the cemetery as usual and I tripped and fell. As I went to get up I saw bare feet in front of me and I immediately felt very uneasy. I stood up and when I did I saw what looked like a woman standing in front of my wearing a white sort of night gown sort of thing that went down to her knees. She was bare foot and she had long black hair and she was looking down at her feet. I felt very unsettled by her kinda like this I could be in danger feeling. I don’t know if that’s the best way to describe the feeling I got it wasn’t like a feeling of immediate danger more of a be very careful sorta feeling if that makes sense. I said hello and she looked up at me and that was when I noticed her eyes were blood red and looked very reptilian with vertical pupils. When she looked at me it was sorta like she was looking through me. She then spoke and said that I needed to be more careful and that I needed to get home then she disappeared. I never saw her again after that and I have no idea what she was but I somehow inherently knew that she could have easily hurt or killed me if she wanted to but she didn’t.

Ghost_-_13,None,False,False,False,119gdkf,False,False,t3_119gdkf,They were surrounding us.,"This is another one of my experiences with the paranormal. It happened in the same location as the last encounter I shared. Dustin's house. This time, we were hanging out in his garage. It was myself, Dustin, and two of our other closest friends. Brandon and Drew. 

The four of us were all gathered in Dustin's garage, simply hanging out and talking about all matter of high school problems. During the talk, Dustin had made his way to the opposite side of the garage, next to the garage door. The three of us hadn't noticed that this was strategic on Dustin's part. See, there was another light switch in the garage, right next to the garage door. 

Dustin had hatched a scheme to scare us by suddenly turning the lights out in the middle of our conversation. It was near midnight, and we were already wound up. It was guaranteed to leave us in complete darkness. However, this didn't go his way or our way either. None of us knew what was going to happen that night.

So, Dustin turned out the lights. It startled us at first, but we quickly realized it was Dustin trying to scare us. We asked multiple times for him to turn the lights back on. He responded with poorly acted confusion. He eventually turned them back on for us. The lights in his garage were very bright. We were blinded for a second and had to let our eyes adjust to the light. That's when we saw it.

For some strange reason, when the lights came back on, the three of us on the opposite side from Dustin were all facing the same way. We all faced the wall opposite the garage door. It was painted wait, so it made this very noticeable to us. We saw a black handprint that was slightly faded. Just this lone handprint. Now, that may seem like it's easily explainable. Which it definitely could be. However, what happened next, can't be. 

The three of us mumbled to each other for a second. All asking if we remembered seeing that handprint before the lights went out. We all agreed that we hadn't. Dustin asked what was going on, and we told him we saw a black handprint. He must have thought we were joking because he didn't take us seriously at all. He turned the lights out on us again. This time, we reacted with a little more anger, telling him to turn the lights back on. 

He tried to joke around with us, but we weren't in a joking mood. He caught the hint and turned the lights back on. When our eyes adjusted to the light again, we saw them. Multiple black handprints. All overlapping each other in a horizontal straight line. Leading from one wall to the next. Every wall in the garage now had a line of overlapped black handprints. They were surrounding us. It looked as though something or someone had been running on all fours, horizontally around us. Circling us. 

Dustin saw them as well. The feeling of terror and panic set in for all of us. We trampled over one another, trying to escape the garage. Drew pushed his hands and his head into my back, ramming me through the door into the house. The three of us spilled onto Dustin's living room floor. We couldn't catch our breath and kept shouting nonsense to each other, trying to make sense of what had just happened. We all had a hard time calming down. We tried to convince ourselves that it didn't even happen and that we only thought that we had seen the handprints. 

However, when we mustered the courage to check. We were greeted with the handprints still being there. The garage then became a restricted area for us when we all hung out. The only time we would go back in was to try and do our own investigating. We never cleaned the handprints off. I'm not sure if it was out of fear of angering whatever had left them or if it was a reminder that it did happen. Either way, it is still one of the craziest experiences I've ever had and it will always stick with me.",7,22.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/119gdkf/they_were_surrounding_us/,False,2023-02-22 22:42:19,False,False,False,0.96,,,,

Its_A_Myth2464,None,False,False,False,118s4br,False,False,t3_118s4br,Immediate Family Sees Grandpa on Separate Occasions,"Don't get too excited. This story isn't creepy or terrifying or... exciting. 🤷‍♀️ It's pretty mundane, imo, and just an experience in my childhood that convinced me ghosts exist. 

Background: My grandfather (Pappa) died when I was 3, and my mom was his only birth-daughter.

Story: My mom had my little brother when I was 9, and also met my (step)dad around this time. Fast-forward a bit.... I'm around 10 or 11. My mom and I had recently moved in with my dad, and my little brother was still sleeping in a crib. My room was at the end of the hallway, and my brother's room was right next to mine. It was night time, I was doing god knows what in my room, and my brother was asleep in his. For whatever normal reason, I left my room (probably to get a snack or something else superbly tempting). The hall light was on and my brother's light was off, but his door was open. I walked right past, thinking nothing at first, but I saw something weird out of the corner of my eye. There was a rocking chair facing my brother's crib (a real chair, not a ghost chair), and I thought I had seen the silhouette of a figure sitting, rocking, watching my little brother sleep. It was large, overweight-looking, with a distinct flat-top haircut. A very familiar silhouette. Of course I did a double-take and it was gone. I was both perplexed and intrigued. Abandoning my previous mission, I walked to the attached garage where my parents were hanging out. I opened the door, and, looking at my parents, said, ""Hi. The weirdest thing just happened. I think I saw Pappa in (name redacted) room, in the rocking chair."" Of course I thought they would chuckle, say 'That is really weird', and we'd laugh a bit and I'd go back to... whatever 10-year-old me was doing. But they didn't laugh. Their eyes got wide and their mouths dropped open. They looked at each other, then back at me. I'm a little weirded out now. I'm like, ""What?"" They were silent for a minute, then one of them asked, ""Are you serious?"" I confirmed and reiterated my story. My parents then proceeded to tell that both of them had also seen my Pappa, each on separate occasions. My mom also saw him in the rocking chair watching my brother, and my dad saw him in the side garage door window. Apparently they had told each other about their own personal experiences beforehand and had laughed it off (like I had planned to do), until they heard mine. Now we're all convinced we really did see my Pappa. I don't think this was a ""mass psychosis"" sort of situation, because we hadn't brought up my Pappa in any conversation at all recently, which is why I thought it was weird and interesting that I'd seen him in the first place.

Conclusion: This is a true story. I'm not going to try and convince anyone otherwise. If you don't believe me, you don't, and that's fine. I've only told people in my inner circle, but I thought, it's been 20-or-so years since it happened, and we have the internet now, so might as well share with the world. 🤷‍♀️",6,26.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/118s4br/immediate_family_sees_grandpa_on_separate/,False,2023-02-22 07:38:28,False,False,False,0.92,,,,
skylillie,None,False,False,False,117xfi0,False,False,t3_117xfi0,My only paranormal experience,"I haven’t shared this story with a lot of people. Mainly because I’ve just never been given the opportunity to bring it up. But me and my sister shared an experience that we will never forget. When I was around 7 and my sister was 9 my family moved into a house that was beside a huge cemetery. I’m talking thousands and thousands of bodies buried there. Along with a mausoleum that had probably a hundred or so people it in. You couldn’t see our house from the road, it was hidden by trees. So our driveway was long, and as you drove up our drive way you could literally read headstones. It was convenient for my family at the time because my dad worked at this cemetery as a grave digger. 
As young kids my sister and I weren’t scared of this house or the cemetery. We hadn’t really ever been exposed to the idea of paranormal things yet. We actually would spend a lot of time walking around the cemetery and the fountain thats there. We would also go visit our dad while he was at work. But my parents were kind of off put about the house once we started living there. I remember them mentioning how there were holes in the corner of the rooms like the previous owner had cameras in the house. But as kids, we didn’t really get why that would be weird. 
My moms mom lived with us at the time. We called her nanny. She had strokes in the past, and was kind of frail. She couldn’t walk that well and needed assistance doing certain things. She was just really weak from her strokes. But at this point in time her mind was still sharp. My nanny’s room and my sisters room were connected by a bathroom. So each room had a door to the bathroom. 
One day my parents went to grocery shop and left us with my nanny to watch us. It probably wouldn’t have been a good idea to do that, but my sister and I were pretty well behaved. We wouldn’t do anything bad or give her a hard time. My sister and I were sitting in the middle of my sisters room playing on the floor. All of a sudden the bathroom door, that was closed, started shaking violently. Like someone was grabbing the door knob and shaking as hard as they could. We immediately got up and went to my nanny. She was sitting in her room watching tv. We stayed in her room until my parents came back. I know for certain it wasn’t her, because she would’ve said so. Even then, there’s no way she would have been able to shake that door like that. She was just too weak. 
My sister had other things happen in that house. Like figures peaking in at her through the crack in her bedroom door. We also would see a little girl with black hair, most of the time not even inside our house. Mostly outside around our house. That’s the only paranormal things that I have ever experienced. But to me, it’s significant especially because I wasn’t the only one to witness it. And my nanny was there to verify it wasn’t her.",5,45.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/117xfi0/my_only_paranormal_experience/,False,2023-02-21 07:21:57,False,False,False,0.98,,,,
Zaubermaus_3,None,False,False,False,116zqve,False,False,t3_116zqve,All the doors slammed open the night two loved ones committed suicide. Deceased aunts voice starts talking to my son,"This happened 9 years ago during my husband’s deployment. 

We lived in military housing. It was just me and my 19 month old son in the house. 

My aunt and I were very close. She died of ovarian cancer 2 months before my son was born. I stayed with her through hospice care. She tried really hard to stay alive until his birth. I’m glad she at least got to feel him kick and move around. 

That day was normal. I spent a couple hours chatting with a childhood friend. Went to bed like normal. 

I get woken at at 3am to every door on the 2nd floor slamming open at once. The force they slammed open, put holes in the wall. I nearly pissed my self. I sit up and freeze. Trying to process what just happened. Silence. Then I heard my aunt’s voice baby talking and cooing my son, from his room. My son is responding to each time I hear her voice. He’s squealing, giggling, baby belly laughing, and shaking the crib. So I hear her, baby responds, hear her , baby responds, and so on. This went on a couple minutes. I start bawling my eyes out because I’ve missed hearing her voice so much. I get up and start walking to my son’s room. They are still continuing until I enter the room. Her voice stops. My son is all happy and riled up. 

I took him and we went to sleep downstairs. I was too freaked out to stay up there. I spent the rest of deployment sleeping on the couch. 

The next day, my nerves were shot. I tried contacting my friend but didn’t hear from him. I tried contacting my uncle to see how he was doing. Don’t hear from him either. Called my cousin and found out my uncle killed himself because he didn’t want to live without my aunt anymore. 

The childhood friend I was talking to  committed suicide that night too. He was talking to all his loved ones before he took his life. He didn’t sound depressed or off. It was the usual banter about the outdoors and science fiction. He was always the strong happy one in the group.

 Still dealing with survivors guilt. 

I patched the holes in the walls. That never happened again with the doors. 

I don’t drink or do drugs. I’ve been in therapy and I have anxiety and depression, but nothing that causes delusions like that.
I’m not into the new age spiritual stuff, so this was very strange for me. 

Finishing the last class for my MBA after that was really hard. 

That was the worst week of my life so far. I lost 2 loved ones in the same night.

I like to think it was my aunt getting to meet my son. 

We named our 2nd child after the friend that died.

nathan5660,None,False,False,False,117820o,False,False,t3_117820o,Terrifying spooky shower,"This will be a long one so sorry about that.

I had a dream lastnight, which was like a memory type dream. Where you remember something that happened to you years ago that you had nearly forgotten. 

So, when I was about 15 and living with my parents, our hot water and heating was heated by a gas boiler. Sometimes it ran out and we had to manually change the dial to switch to the full gas bottles and buy full ones. 

This one time the dial was stuck, it wouldnt move at all. It was the middle of december in rural Devon in the UK. We had no fire at that time so no hot water or heating at all, not sure what to do we ended up packing our bags and going to a friends house.

The friend lived in an old farmhouse and ran the holiday place that had been built there in the 80s. Self catered holiday homes, built from the old farm buildings and converted. They let us use the shower in one of the holiday lets as they were closed during december. So we had free reign of the whole holiday house. 

Mum and dad were in the main house with our friends, while I was left to shower and head on inside when I was ready to before sleeping in the big house. Im getting undressed in the bathroom and forgot all my towels, so as I was alone I stayed naked and went into the front room to find the towels I had left behind. Grabbed them, brought them into the bathroom with me and put them on the closed toilet lid. Got in the shower and began washing myself. 

After about five minutes or so I could feel a cold breeze blowing in from somewhere. Figuring it was a window left open or a door not quite closed properly I poked my head out from behind the shower door, and my towels were on the floor in the doorway. I know that no one had been in there, as I would have heard the very big solid oak creaking front door open. I thought they must have slid off on their own so I threw them over the towel rack and made sure they wouldnt fall off and got back in the shower. 

Everything was fine, untill I began to wash my genitals. When i heard a VERY loud growl and snarls from the bathroom. I stood stock still not sure what the heck to do in this situation. Im naked, alone, and theres a thing growling at me. As i stand terrifed, i notice that I cant SEE anything in the bathroom with me, but I can HEAR it. Something inside me made me shout out ""IM NOT AFRAID OF YOU!"" for some reason. And flung the shower door open and there was nothing. No dog, no human playing a prank on me, bathroom door was still closed and locked. 

But my towels were on the floor again. 

Feeling so scared and freaked out I just ran out of the bathroom, out of the holiday let, across the courtyard and into the big house pounding on the door. Totally naked banging on the door crying and hyperventilating our friend let me in. Saw me in such a mess and grabbed me inside and shit the door. 

She brought me into the front room and stood my infront of the fire while my Dad ran and got me some towels. I turned around and my mother, and our friends entire family were sitting in thr front room looking at me. Their two daughters were white as sheets and looked about as terrified as I was. 

I explained what I had just expeirienced to everyone in the room, trying my best not to collapse in tears. When I finished telling them, the Grandma of our friends family looked at me and said ""Did it only growl when you were washing or touching your genitals?"" And i was like yeah more or less. 

Everyone in our friends family looked at eachother in a way that told me, they had ALL either had that same experience at one point or other, or been told by guests that it happened. 

Turns out both daughters had the same thing happen in that same shower when they were having hot water issues. The mother had the same thing, as did one of the daughters boyfriends only the day before. Eventually I was calm and sat back on the sofa, still naked under my towels. NO ONE was willing to go get my clothes from the holiday let shower room, so Grandma went and got me some PJs they usually give to guests when they come to stay. I put them on while my parents held the towels up for me and joined them back on the sofa. 

I didnt sleep that night at all, and was so scared of it happening again I spent the whole night with my hands deathgripping the headboard of the bed as to not touch myself anywhere. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

ANY idea what the hell it was? Some kind of demon thats against self hygine or something? I have spent the last ten years trying to think what it could have been. Turns out that at least 20 guests have experienceed the same thing while showering in that holiday let.

Technical-Writing810,None,False,False,False,116kg03,False,False,t3_116kg03,Pennies landing on me,"Hi everyone,

I'm pretty new to all this stuff - I've just had some spooky stuff happening in my flat lately. 

I live in Edinburgh in Scotland and this flat is about 250 years old, which isn't unusual here. I don't know much about the history except it was part of a larger tenement block which was mostly destroyed during the Blitz. 

Anyway, I've lived in this flat for almost two years with no problems. Then, about a month ago I got up to go toilet and when I was in the hallway my bedroom door slammed shut behind me. I jumped but rationalised that it could've been a draft.

Then about a two weeks ago I was in the shower when a two pence piece (a large round coin) landed on my shoulder and fell into the bath (the only thing above me was the shower head and the ceiling. 

Then a few days ago I was lying on top of my bed on my back texting when a pound coin bounced off my chest. Again the only thing above me is the ceiling.

I phoned a psychic hotline on Google because I was spooked. She couldn't tell me anything about what it was, except to burn sage and open the windows, which I have done. 

However, last night a book from my bookshelf fell out of the shelf and onto the floor. It gave me such a scare.  

I'm not sure what to do now. I should say, I don't get a bad feeling, like I think whatever it is it's okay, but it's freaking me out because it's well, the unknown I guess. 

Do I ignore it? Is it trying to tell me something? What do I do?",7,25.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/116kg03/pennies_landing_on_me/,False,2023-02-19 18:41:30,False,False,False,0.89,,,,
saucity,None,False,False,False,116b89l,False,False,t3_116b89l,Buddha… and the Talking Black Brick. [Child Sensitivity],"My best friend has a 3-year-old who I babysit for, and see often. I love her. This is an extraordinary child. She’s highly intelligent, and perceptive. She’s definitely a **handful** when things don’t go her way, but she’s an imaginative, *extremely* social little one. I’ll call her Tee.

For a little background, it’s not the first time Tee has had her mom and I absolutely transfixed. 

My dad got me a beautiful, red, Smiling Buddha statue, and he’s in my front yard. Tee and my friend came over one day, and Tee noticed the statue. She excitedly ran over to him, and started [talking to him, kissing him, cuddling, and resting her little forehead against his.](https://imgur.com/a/xZVDxSG) 

She told us he was ‘the wrong color’, that he’s not red, he’s really *all* colors, like a rainbow, “but MORE,” and that they were imagining together. She had her forehead pressed against his, eyes closed, silent. My friend asked, “Are you praying?” And Tee firmly said “NO! We are *IMAGINING*,” irritated that the thick adults were clearly interrupting her and The Buddha. We were pretty dumbfounded. All we could do was stare. Tee was so intensely serious, and like… very obviously *moved*, and seemed to be perceiving *something.*

Fast forward a few months, and I’m there at her place at least twice a week, tutoring her other daughter in Spanish and ASL, and sort-of-babysitting Tee. Tee was visiting a half-brother earlier in the week, and I come over Thursday-Fridays (but I didn’t know about the visit.)

As soon as my friend leaves, Tee takes my hand, leads me to the living room to sit, and she’s *very* seriously talking to me about “The Black Brick”. She said “that house was bad, and scary. I DO NOT like that house. I had to hide from The Black Brick in the ceiling that was talking to me.” I had no idea about her going to the play-date, or what she meant, so I’m like, “whaaaat are you talkin’ about, buddy? …WHAT DID IT SAY?”

She said The Brick didn’t want her there, and was scaring her on purpose, to get her to leave. She was visibly shook, telling me this. The Brick had “little black smokes coming out of it, that HE wanted to get me’’. I imagined smoky-looking tendrils, but I didn’t want her to explain, if she didn’t want to. She wiggled her little fingers as if to show me tendrils coming for her. 

I validated what she was feeling, not outright confirming, nor denying, The Brick; just that I’m so sorry, and how that must have been really scary. I can almost talk to her like an adult. I asked a couple more questions like, “…but you know you’re safe, right?” And she said yes. Away from that bad Brick. 

I made her a little apples n’ peanut butter snack, to calm her down and redirect her thoughts, and she very quietly sat on my lap, and just sorta snuggled on me while her sister and I studied. This is very rare for her. She usually messes with us on purpose, teasing us (imagine someone going “la-la-la, blah-blah-blah!”, right in our faces, clearly mimicking us speaking in Spanish, lol), unless she’s highly engrossed in playing, or watching a show… For almost the whole hour, she quietly snuggled! Her sister and I kept exchanging looks like, ‘are you seeing this?’ I even felt her head for a fever; is she sick…? She felt cool to me, so she was just snugglin’.

When my friend comes home, I wait til they’re all settled, and take her outside and ask her about this. She’s like “OH! I forgot to tell you!! This was **crazy!**” Tee had a play date at brother’s, and she’d never been to this house before, brother’s mom’s place. (It’s a tragic and complicated blended and broken little family. I say ‘little’ but it’s 6 kids altogether). 

When they got to brother’s, she starts getting very upset, specifically about the house - that it’s bad, it’s scary, she doesn’t like it. They chalk it up to overall stress, maybe being in a new place, the sadness of the overall situation, and being tired and overstimulated.

My friend drops her off, planning to come back in 3 hours… but the mom had to call my friend to get Tee early. It was only supposed to be a pretty short visit, but an hour or so later, she gets the call. She hears that Tee hid under a coffee table the whole time, just SCREAMING and crying, pointing at the ceiling, yelling about the Black Brick, completely inconsolable. Would not come out, would not calm down, and couldn’t stop absolutely *flipping out*. 

My friend had to come in and extract her from under the table, and told me she felt embarrassed that Tee’s behavior was such that another adult couldn’t handle it. It’s certainly not Tee’s first explosive tantrum. I don’t know much about this other mom. She may not be the best parent or person overall, but she does have experience with young children. I just can’t speak to what she actually tried to get Tee out of there, and to calm down. Maybe she was dismissive, or not comforting… but maybe there simply was no comforting, or redirecting her away from feeling very afraid.

I asked my friend if the house was decrepit, or scary-looking; she said no, it was cute! Just a typical, rural house. New-ish. I asked if it was a brick fireplace, *anything* brick, and she said no - the ceiling was all white, in a newly finished basement. No fireplace, no bricks.

Her situation is such that it wouldn't surprise me if this was some kind of trauma response, or a VERY clever way to get what she wanted (maybe to go home). But it's such a highly specific description, it gave me cold chills listening to her tell me about it. I am soooo curious, but I don’t want to re-traumatize Tee by asking questions. It’s better if this scary memory fades for her, whatever it is. 

…But I definitely just gave her her own little tiny Buddha. 💕",5,45.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/116b89l/buddha_and_the_talking_black_brick_child/,False,2023-02-19 14:10:55,False,False,False,0.92,,,,
theapothecarium,None,False,False,False,1160ucd,False,False,t3_1160ucd,The haunting at the brewery,"
I was reading some true stories on this sub and I remembered that i never shared this one. 

It’s not super elaborate or flashy, but it actually happened, i’d love to hear your thoughts about it.

About a decade back i used to work at a brewery/pub. It was set in a pretty big and old building, from the early 1900’s. 

I worked there for a couple of years, and most of the time the it was pretty chill, but backbreaking at times. On my time working there i had two experiences that i can only describe as supernatural.

The first one, it was a particular late night and i was task with closing up the hangar/loading docks. Closing it up was making sure there wasn’t anything obstructing where the trucks would park, stacking up any loose crates, turning the lights off and locking it all up. 

I was about done, so i turn of the lights and as i’m making my way to the door a beer bottle comes rolling towards me from the dark between the tall stacks of crates. It wasn’t forceful or anything, it looked like someone gently placed it on the floor and rolled it towards me. 

I didn’t thought too much of it, so i picked up the bottle and placed it inside a half empty crate. I turned around and as i started walking another bottle comes rolling from the same place, than another one. Tired and thinking it was a coworker trying to fuck with me i shout “Hey, alright, you got me. Come on i gotta close it up” I expected to hear laughter or something, but instead i was dead silent. 

I waited for a couple minutes, turned on my flashlight and started looking around the stacks of crates for what I thought it would be a giggling coworker. After searching each corner and turn i gave up. I was a little weirded out at this point, but i just picked up the two bottles from the ground and placed in the same crate as the first one.

I turned off my flashlight and shouted at the darkness “Alright, I’m locking up. See you tomorrow” just as a finished saying that a crate full of bottles fell from one on the stacks and landed two feet from me, glass shards and beer exploding everywhere.

The next day i told my boss about it and he said it was probably a rat. The thing is, those crates when full probably weights 20 pounds, how could a rat push it? 
Talking to my coworkers they told me that they’ve also experienced weird stuff during closing hours.

My second experience happened again when i was closing the place. This time i was closing the pub.

When closing the pub the last thing you usually do is restock the walk-in freezer. The freezer is probably just as old as the building itself and it sits underground, right beneath the bar. 

I was down there filling that enormous thing with kegs and crates. Being a very old freezer from a time when safety wasn’t a big concern the thing doesn’t open from the inside, no handle, nothing. Just a flat, plain steel door.

So i did what I always did when i had to go inside that thing, i put a keg securing the door open. I was halfway through the task when i hear the door slamming shut, i rush towards the door but it’s locked shut. I started pounding on it, but the only other person there was my boss in the office, two floors above me, probably with his door closed. I tried my phone, but since I’m locked underground inside a steel and led box i had no service.

I was wearing only jeans ans a T-shirt so things were getting chilly pretty quickly, my face was going numb and my hands were getting stiff, i made a blanket out of cardboard but it was doing very little keeping the cold at bay. 

The only reason I didn’t freeze to death was because i had a date with a regular and she went there looking for me. She asked my boss where i was and when he couldn’t find me he went to the basement and found me inside the freezer. I was there for about 45 minuted when he found me and i was starting to consider writing a letter to my parents and drinking myself to sleep.

My boss installed a chain to keep the door open after that, but i refused to ever walk in to that death trap again. Weirdest part, the keg i had holding the door open was at the other side of the room when i got out. It was a full steel keg, not something that just slides away, let alone quietly.

I stop workin there shortly after for unrelated reason.

Whoopsiedoodle1995,None,False,False,False,115mvaw,False,False,t3_115mvaw,My family has seen many ghosts:,"I find it really interesting because many of my family members have had paranormal experiences, and yet claim they don’t believe in ghosts. Here is a collection of those experiences: 

1. When my great grandmother passed away both my mother and aunt had strange dreams about her. My aunt had a gentle dream: her grandmother asked “why didn’t you tell me about all the amazing things you did?”. My aunt admitted to me that she kept a lot of her rebellious/ hilarious behavior secret from her grandmother. My moms dream was quite different—incredibly frightening. Her grandmother was screaming and begging for help. My mom feared something bad was happening to her grandmother’s soul. 

2. When my grandfather passed away my uncle went to ID the body. While in the waiting room, he claims that my grandfather walked up to him and said “everything is going to be okay”, and then left. My uncle was confused but reassured that my grandfather was alive and well. But when he IDed the body, it was indeed the body of my grandfather. Just before the burial, as the local gravedigger was digging out the place for my grandfathers coffin, he paused and looked into the trees. He said he saw my grandfather sitting there, watching his own grave being dug. 

3. Just before my great aunt passed away she claimed her deceased husband was visiting her every morning. She said “it’s like he’s leaving the car on for me”.

4. Similarly to the above: just before my boyfriends grandma passed away she also claimed she had visitors. Her deceased husband, mother, and son visited her one by one and told her it was time. Each visit she refused to go. Saying “not yet”.

5. My family had 2 cats. And I found one’s body after it had been hit by a car. For the next month I thought I saw the ghost of my cat. It kept walking by doorways. (Our cats were different colors, and sometimes the other was sitting right beside me).

valkyriansofearth,None,False,False,True,115d3n5,False,False,t3_115d3n5,my mom saw the white lady in west africa in the 80s,"When I was in middle school, my mom was born in Cotonou, Benin, a country situated in West Africa (which was colonized the French and the Portuguese) told me a story she never told anyone else. She was 12 ( so it was in the early 80s) it was very late at night and she was sneaking up to see her friend by going to her house. It was a full moon and the streets were flooded. My mom was walking in an extremely dirty part of the city which would be the ""slums"". No else was outside at this moment, the streets were dead empty. Suddenly she felt a strong and cold wind force passing by ( in her words) this when she spotted something in the distance thanks to the street lamps : a pale white lady dressed in a long white dress/robe reaching her ankles with a blue belt ( I think? or perhaps a ribbon?) around her waist, she was wearing a white veil or something white hiding her hair according to my mom, her brown hair was long and curly, and she was doing this creepy pose, her arms in front of her body with her hands joined together and her lower arms raised a bit and the most creepy part, she was smiling! According to my mom, the strong wind came from the lady who slowly walking towards her. Obviously as most would given the context, my mom a little west african girl who never met a white person in her life, was straight up horrified and felt chills so she ran for her life to her friends house. When she reached her friends door, and she turned, the lady wasn’t there anymore. 
I always wondered and tried to come up with a logical explanation for this. First of all, I have a typical strict west african mom who isn’t the kind to make up jokes and lies to scare her kids. She doesn’t even believe in ghosts. Secondly, I have no explanation as to what a white woman would do very late at night in this part of the city where my mom was born, especially dressed this way.  
My mom has been living in France half of her life now, and she’s convinced, just like she was at the time, that she encountered the Virgin Mary. As a child, she came from a muslim upbringing, it’s only when she came in France she got into the catholic faith. Now, she’s in her 50s and still convinced of what she saw. And I believe what she saw, not her explanation to it though.

Twingirlmomma,None,False,False,True,114ulzd,False,False,t3_114ulzd,Something wanted to hurt me while another entity warned my parents upstairs,"So my whole life I have had minor experiences with the paranormal, things like hearing someone say my name or footsteps when I'm alone in a house or at work. However, I have had 2 bigger experiences, and this is the scary one:

When I(40f) was 20, my parents rented a house, let me take over the basement. My parents' room, along with my sisters room and an office, were on the second floor with the living room. We had no issues when we first moved in or for the first few months, which I truly believe was because a friend of mine was staying with me in the basement. After she was kicked out of her house, she stayed with us only until she was able to get her own place. However, as soon as she left, I began waking up about 2am every night and seeing a dark shadow across the room. At first, I thought maybe it was my eyes playing tricks on me and just tried to ignore it. Around this time, though, I began to get a bad feeling down there and started spending more time upstairs when just hanging out at home. I was working at a pub, and so I would often be home during the day alone while my parents were at work and my sister was in school. It was at this time I started hearing footsteps walk up and down the hallway on the second floor, which I later found out my mom would hear if she was home alone as well. But whatever was upstairs felt peaceful. 

Now this is where it gets a little scary, I started to realize that the dark figure I would see at night was getting closer. I didn't notice right away because it would just stand there, but each night, it was about one step closer than the night before. Now, looking back, I probably should have moved into the office upstairs when it got to my bed but...I didn't. 

The last night I stayed in the basement, I woke up to this black shadow on top of me. I felt as though I could not breathe, and I started to panic while at the same time I could not move at all. It was terrifying! It felt like it lasted forever, and yet it was most likely only a few minutes. I took my blanket and pillow, ran up the stairs, and slept on the couch in the living room. The next morning, when my mother woke up and saw me sleeping on the couch, she asked me why. When I told her what happened, she looked pale like all the blood drained from her face. Then she told me that at the same time she and my dad(who is very much a non-believer) had a very similar experience, only strangely not as scary more like a warning. We only used the basement for storage after that. To this day, we think whatever was upstairs was trying to warn my parents of what was happening to me downstairs.",5,133.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/114ulzd/something_wanted_to_hurt_me_while_another_entity/,False,2023-02-17 18:59:33,False,False,False,0.99,,,,
peachykory,None,False,False,False,114m1fs,False,False,t3_114m1fs,Something strange has happened to me while living in my nana’s home.,"I have always been able to see spirits. As a kid I would hear things in my childhood home walking around calling for me while everyone else was asleep. My mother at one point saw a dark figure with red eyes and in response called some women from the church to cleanse the house. Now, that was just a few instances at my childhood home. What I’ve seen at my nanas was way worse. 

When I was about 12 my parents split and eventually we went to stay with my nana for a while. I was brushing my teeth in the bathroom with the door open when I glanced over and saw a man’s face right beside me staring at me. This obviously freaked me out since I was young, but my nana had always just said it was my papa that died when I was two. 

The strangest thing was a few months ago. I was sitting in the living room with my cousin J waiting for his sister C to come inside from the back porch to play some card games. She was out there for a while so when I finally saw her walk past I said something to J along the lines of “oh, there she is finally.” I had figured she’d gone to her room to put her stuff away, but then the back door opened and she walked right in. I was completely freaked out. I had seen some strange things but nothing like this before. I figured I was just seeming the house spirit until a few nights ago the same thing happened with the same cousin. 

The room I'm staying in at my nanas doesn’t have a door on it, so I pinned up a throw blanket for some privacy. The blanket only covers half of the door so I can still see people’s legs as they walk by. The other night at around 1:40 I was still up on my phone facing the wall. I rolled over and as I did I saw C walking past quickly. It scared me a little, but since her room is right next to the one I’m in it made sense. She probably had to use the bathroom. Not even ten minutes later, I hear her door open and she walks out to use the bathroom. I called her and asked if she had just walked out and she very sleepily said no. That’s when I knew I hadn’t seen her then either. I should also mention that C has seen something dark in this house standing over people while they sleep. One of the times was in the room I’m in. She’s also seen a white spirit in the home too. 

My nana like to think all these encounters are my papa, but I don’t think so.",2,18.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/114m1fs/something_strange_has_happened_to_me_while_living/,False,2023-02-17 14:31:36,False,False,False,0.95,,,,
Ghost_-_13,None,False,False,False,1145ezm,False,False,t3_1145ezm,Keys,"I've had many paranormal experiences throughout my life and even some unexplained experiences that make me question my own reality. If you want to hear more of my experiences, just let me know. I'm an open book. 

I call this one Keys for a very specific reason. When I was in high school, my long-time friend group would hang out regularly on the weekends. During one specific year, we used one house as our hangout spot. One member of the friend group had just moved into this house, and his mom let us do whatever we wanted. For the sake of his privacy, we can call him Dustin. The other members of the friend group were not there for this occasion, so their names do not matter right now. I had an experience at Dustin's house that has stuck with me to this day. Many experiences, actually, but this one in particular. 

I was at Dustin's house one night, along with his younger sister and his cousin. We were all sitting in his living room, all sharing space on a giant bean bag he owned. We were all excited that night because Dustin's mom had decided to stay at a friend's house that night. So we had the house all to ourselves. It seemed like a normal night until, suddenly, we all heard what sounded like a window breaking.  It sounded like it was coming from Dustin's little sisters room. Then it sounded like someone was tearing through the room, throwing things all around and breaking things. 

Dustin's little sister and cousin began crying and screaming immediately. In a panic, Dustin and I ran to his sisters room (completely unarmed). We busted open her bedroom door, expecting to be greeted with whoever had just broken into the house. However, we were greeting with a room that was completely clean. 

Nothing was out of place, and the window wasn't broken. We thought that maybe we mistook what room had been broken into. We proceeded to check every room in the house, only to be greeted with the same thing. No windows had been broken, and there was nobody else in the house. We were understandably confused by this. The four of us huddled together on the bean bag once more to console one another. 

That's when I heard it. The sound that would completely change my perception of the paranormal. Of course, I didn't know at that moment that this sound would have such an impact. It sounded like a set of keys being dropped on a table, in his kitchen to our left. I jumped up to investigate, but once again, I found nothing. The rest of the night was uneventful, but we couldn't sleep. The next day, I told my mom about what had happened. She entertained the idea and listened to the story half-heartedly. That is, until I meanttioned the set of keys dropping. 

That made her eyes go wide, which obviously concerned me. She told me that she needed to tell me something. She told me that when she was in high school, some of her friends were a but unsavory. Not only was she close friends with a practicing witch, but she even dated a Satan worshiper. It may have been a rebellious teen choice, seeing as how she was actually very religious. He eventually asked her to join in on a seance or a ritual of some kind. 

She sat in the circle with him but refused to say anything. She told me that during the ritual, things began flying around the room and scared her so bad that she ran out and never talked to that guy again. She said that she felt as though something may have followed her though. She said that she always felt like she was being watched and as if something was always creeping up behind her after that. 

So she told her friend that is a practicing witch about this event. Her friend told her that a demon may have tried to attach itself to her and that she needed some sort of protection. Her witch friend told her that she could help attach a protective entity to her. So her witch friend performed a ritual of her own. (Obviously, my mom didn't make the best decisions). 

After the ritual was over, her witch friend told her that the entity was with her and always would be. That he would protect her from any evil spirits that may intend harm. She then told my mom that she would know even this entity was present because he would make himself known. She said that you would know he was there if you heard the sound of keys jingling and that his name was keys. When my mom told me that, I felt ice in my veins. 

I obviously wondered if I had heard keys there that night at Dustin's. However, if he is attached to my mom, then why would I have heard him? Does he protect her and everything that belongs to her? I would ask if he is even real. It just seems like too scary a coincidence. What could I have heard if it wasn't keys? Why did we all hear someone or something absolutely tearing Dustin's little sisters room apart, only to suddenly stop. With everything still in its place.

This medium always felt the need to tell my mom that bad spirits are latched on to me, and have always been with me and feed off of me. Ofc my mother shared that with me and her concerns. I didn’t believe in ghosts so I brushed it off. Until much later on at 19 years old I still had not let go of her. I played the ouija bored with a group of friends, begging her to come through. Sadly she never did. The spirits were respectful, and said that she had not fully passed over yet to communicate. And it would always spell out “time” I felt 4 years was a long time already. I didn’t like that answer. I took the board home with me, and played it alone. That was then when I realized it was all real. I asked questions it answered. It was real. Ghost we’re real, it was not my grandmother, it was a good spirit at first who said I could talk to it, I cried and said I wanted to kill myself. It said no but then the speed changed it started going fast and spelling “zo zo” over and over now, I’ve seen many YouTube videos to know it’s wasn’t a good spirit anymore , I thought it was all fake but it happened in front of me, alone. You would imagine I said goodbye and stopped. But I kept trying to get my grandma I couldn’t give up, but it kept a going back to zo zo. Now I’ve tried to play with with friends for fun now, I’m 21 I thought it was past me with this zo zo spirit. No matter who, no matter how many people if I’m touching the board, that’s the only spirit that would come through. (I stopped playing cause everyone was scared even I was) since all that I’ve acknowledged they are there, which I regret bc they make it know they are. Some good, some nice and warm and comforting, others not so much, for awhile now I feel myself getting touched in bed, and even sometimes goes as far as sexual, I get pinned and I can feel it but can’t stop it , I just lay there and cry.  I’ve tried sage and it never worked, my negative energy is just to strong I guess. I just don’t know what to do or how to make it all go away. I know it was stupid i was young and i just wanted to talk to her, but i regret it. i needed to get this weight off of me. thank you",2,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/114i8fs/it_was_all_my_fault/,False,2023-02-17 11:32:20,True,False,False,0.73,,,,
PatientDisastrous839,None,False,False,False,113t123,False,False,t3_113t123,The Banshee in the Bog," 

Irish  folklore  is  littered  with  mysterious  and  terrifying  creatures;  the  kind  that  sound  so  unbelievable,  but  that  people  speak  of  which  such  conviction  that  you  can't  help  but  wonder  if  there  must  be  a  layer  of  truth  buried  in  there.  Old  people  in  particular  still  hold  a  belief  of  the  fairy  folk  and  lore  of  ancient  Ireland.  Before  she  passed  away,  my  grandmother  would  have  sat  us  down  in  her  cottage  and  filled  its  walls  with  the  tales  of  all  kinds  of  spirits,  from  silently  watchful  black  hounds  to  the  kelpie,  a  water  horse  that  would  seduce  you  into  riding  it  before  darting  into  the  depths  of  a  lake,  or  lough,  and galloping  into  its  murky  depths.  When  my  parents  would  collect  us,  mum  would  scowl  when  she  found  out  about  the  ghost  story  session,  knowing  that neither  my  brother  nor  I  would  be  getting  much  sleep  that  night.  Nevertheless,  I  cherish  these  fireplace  memories,  as  they  take me  back  to   a  simpler  time  when  the  dark  winter  evenings  would   be  filled  with  life  in  the  form  of granny's  lilting ,  aged  voice.  


My  favourite  of  these  creatures  -  or  least  favourite  I suppose,  given  the  endless  amount  of  nightmares  it  implanted  into  my  mind  as  a  child  -  was  the  Banshee,  a  spirit  tied  to  particular  families.  Legend  has  it  that  she  appears  in  different  forms,  but  tends  to  favour  that  of  either  a  beautiful  but  distraught  woman,  or  of  a  hunched,  ailing  older  washer  woman,  if  it  appeared  by  sight  at  all.  It  is  even  more  distinct,  you  see,   by  its  unearthly  cry;  its  wails  and  weeps  would  fill  a  room,  or  would  be  audible  from  miles  away  across  the  countryside.  The  person  who  crosses  path  with  the  banshee  or  its  cry  should  quickly  alert  the  family,  as  this  is  a  signal  that  someone  from  the  family  has  died,  or  is  set  to  die.  Yes,  the  banshee  is  an  omen  of  death.  


As  I  grew  older,  I  became  cynical  to  the  tales  my  grandmother  had  spouted,  including  that  of  the  banshee.  I  moved  to  the  city  for  university  at  18,  and  in  immersing  myself  with  life  in  the  modern  world,  the  ways  of  country  life  seemed  to  evaporate.  A  small  scale  reflection  of  the  increasingly  modernising  world,  I  guess.  Sad  when  you  think  about  it,  isn't it?  


That  was,  until  one  particular  summer.  My  parents  had  recently  downsized  to  a  small  cottage  deep  in  the  barren  Irish  west,  where  the  roar  of  citylife  was  inaudible.  I  stayed  with  my  parents  for  the  month  of  July,  and  spent  long,  languid  days  roaming  the  nearby  fields  and  looking  out  for  signs  of  wildlife,  such  as  the  foxes  that  roamed  late  at  dusk,  or  the  bats  that  flew  low  along  the  lanes,  which  were  laiden  with  sprawling  plantlife.   


My  story  begins,  I  suppose,  in  the  second  week  of  my  stay.  I  had  taken  to  going  for  twilight  walks,  making  the  most  of  our  northern  sun,  which  can  see daylight  lasting  until  close  to  11pm.  I  was  some  miles  away  from  the  house,  but  could  sense  darkness  approaching,  and  decided  to  make  my  way  home.  Night  time  in  that  part  of  the  country  is  utterly  dark,  and  not  something  you  want  to  find  yourself  swallowed  by.  


 It  was  as  I  was  walking  back  that  I heard  it:  the  most  startling,  biting  cry.  It  seemed  to  fill  the  world  around  me,  as  though  echoing  against  stone  walls,  even  though  I  was  surrounded  by  open  nature.  I  can  try  to  describe  it  by  saying  that  it  was  on  one  hand  the  sound  of  a  woman  in  sharp  pain,  but  equally  that  of  a  grieving  mother,  sobbing  at  the  loss  of  her  child.   


I  was  momentarily  horrified;  in  one  moment  it  seemed  that  all  of  my  cynicism  was  laid  to  rest,  and  that  I  should  run  home  without  question.   What  sort  of  horrific  creature  was  capable  of  producing  a  sound  like  this?  However,  I  then  tried  to  apply  logic;  afterall,  can't  foxes  make  the  most  spine tingling  noises  when  they're  distressed,  or  even  in  heat?    There  had  to  be  purely  natural  explaination  to  this,  in  spite  of  how  undisputedly  unnatural  it  sounded.  Whatever  it  was,  I  didn't  want  to  stick  around  to  find  out.  I  would  run  home,  I  decided,  and  alert  my  parents,  just  in  case  someone  was  genuinely  in  distress  or  harm.  


I  began  to  pick  up  my  pace,  breaking  into  a  jog,  but  something  in  the  peripheries  of  my  vision  brought  me  to  a  sharp  and  sudden  stop.  To  my  left  was  bogland,  an  area  that  I  had  been  warned  never  to  walk  in  as  it  would  be  all  too  easy  to  sink  into  the   wet  ground  and  become  stuck,  or  even  suffocated.  It  was  shocking  to  me,  therefore,  that  in  the  midst  of  this  bogland  stood  a  woman,  long  silvery  blonde  hair  twisting  in  the  evening  breeze.  The  relative  distance  and  encroaching  darkness  made  it  hard  to  make  her  out  entirely,  but  she  looked  to  be  in  her  early  to  mid  twenties  -  my  age  -  and  her  face  was  contorted  in  what  looked  like  either  pain  or  horror.  It  was  from  her  mouth,  I  realised,  that  the  bone  chilling  screams  were emerging.   


Initially  I  was  stunned;  this  was  so  adverse  to  anything  I  had  experienced  in  this  part  of  the  world  so  far,  which  seemed  so  devoid  of  alarm  or  drama  or  consequence.  But  I  shook  myself  then  and  called  out  to  the  woman  as  loudly  as  I  could:  


""Hello!  What's  wrong?  Are  you  stuck?!""  


She  seemed  to  register  me,  small  eyes  turning  in  my  direction,  but  there  was  no  response,  aside  from  the  continuous  screech which  now  pounded  in  my  head.  


""Hello?!  I'm  going  to  try  to  get  help!  I'll  be  back  as  soon  as  I  can!""  


With  that,  I  ripped  my  eyes  from  the  woman  and darted  back  to  the  house  as  quickly  as  I  could.  I  was   around  a  mile  away,  but  phone  signal  was  limited  in  that  part  of  the  country,  and  I  knew  I'd  need  to  get  home  in  order  to  do  something  to  assist  the  woman.  It  would  have  been  a  risk  to  my  own  life  to  have  walked  across  the  bogland  towards  her.  


When  I  got  home,  my  parents'  warm  faces  quickly  dropped  to  looks  of  alarm  upon  registering  me.  


""What  is  it?  You  look  as  if  you've  seen  a  ghost!""  


I  quickly  filled  them  in  on  what  I'd  seen,  and  they  sprung  into  action,  grabbing  the  phone  and  alerting  the  local  Garda,  our  policeforce.  In  the  meantime  my  father  and  I  lept  into  the  car  to  make  our  way  back  to  the  spot,  whilst  my  mother  waited  for  the Garda  to  arrive.   


By  car  we were there within  minutes,  and  I  quickly  directed  my  father  to  where  I  had  seen  the  incident.  I  pride  myself  on  my  sense  of  direction,  and  the  lane  is  fairly  straightforward,  so  I  was  utterly  bemused  when  I  realised  that  there  was  no  woman  in  sight,  nor  sound  within  earshot  bar  the  standard  noises  of  a  country  evening.  We  scanned  the  area,  but  still,  nothing.  


When  my  mother  arrived  with  the  constable,  he  questioned  me  about  where  I  had  seen  the  woman,  and  raised  his  eyebrow  when  I said that  she  was  no  longer  there.    


""There's  no  way  she  could  have  been  submerged  in  that  space  of  time;  you  said  she  was  standing  fully upright  when  you  saw  here,  right?""  


""That's  right.  She  was  a  bit  of  distance  away,  but  it  didn't  look  like  her  legs  were  submerged  at  all.  It  was  the  screaming  that  made  me  run  for  help.""  


He  nodded.   


""OK  son,  thank  you.  Could  you,  very  clearly,  tell  me  once  again  exactly  what  you   saw?  Try   not  to  miss  anything out.""  


I  did  so,  relaying  the  story  to  him  again  and  trying  to  interpret  his  facial  reactions  as  I  did  so.  He  remained  quite  neutral,  writing  my  account  onto  his  notepad.  When  I  finished,  he  paused,  before  speaking  slowly.  


""Right.  I'm  going  to  say  first  of  that  given  how  few  people  live   around  here,  I  myself  can't  say  that  I  know  anyone  fitting  that  description.  I  like  to  think  I  know  each  and  everyone  around these parts.  However,  I'm  going  to file  a  report  and  investigate  this  further.  It  might  be  that  she  got  herself  free  and  walked  off  again.""  


Here  he  stopped, and  bit  the  end  of  his  pen,  looking  thoughtful,  before  continuing  with  some  visible  discomfort:

""I  want  to  thank  you  for  alerting  me  about  this.  I  just  want  to  say  though,  before  I set off ...  I've  heard  of  cases  like  this  in  the  past.  Figures  -  women  -  appearing  around  the  countryside  and  alarming  a  passerby  with  their  cry.   


I ... well,  again,  officially  I'm  going  to  handle  this  as  I'd  handle  any  other  case,  but  I  want  you  to  do  me  a  favour.  Check  in  with your  family  this  evening,  and  see  how  they're doing.  It  might  sound  odd,  but ...  can  you  do  that  for  me?""  


Dad  looked  perplexed  at  this,  and  seemed  like  he  was  going  to  ask  further  questions,  but  mum interjected, nodding.  


""Yes  officer.  I  think  I understand  you.  We'll  do  that.""  


With  that  we  drove  home.  The  darkness  of  the  land  around  us  was  impenetrable,  aside  from  the  light  of  the  car's  full  beam.  It  was  a  moonless  night.  


...  


We  didn't  need  to  contact  our  family  members  that  evening.  Well,  we  got  in  contact,  but  what  I  mean  to  say  is  that  they  reached  us  first.  My  mother's  brother-in-law  had  sent  her  a  message  when  we'd  been out.  


The  message  wasn't  long.  It  simply  read:  'Hi  Bridget.  Tried  to  contact  you  but  no  reply.   Please  call.'  


When  mum  got  through,  she  was  distraught  to  find  out  that  her  sister  had  passed  away  that  evening.  It  had  been  a  sudden  medical  event  that  nobody  had  predicted.  Aunt Sarah  had  been  living  with  her  husband  and  family  in  the  USA  for  years.  We  saw  her  biannually  most  years,  but  the  death  shook  us  up  nevertheless.  


In  the  days  that  followed,  we  sprung  into  action,  assisting  with  funeral  arrangements  in  whatever  way  we  could  and  booking  flights  to  Boston.  I  didn't  voice  it  to  my  parents,  not  wanting  to  upset  them  further,  but  I  couldn't   help  but  consider  the  incident  with  the  woman  in  the  bog,  and  what  the  officer  had  said  to  us.  My  logical  mind  tried  its  best  to  protest,  but  my  memory  kept  tiptoeing  back  to  the  stories  my  grandmother  had  told  me  years  ago,  particularly those  of  the  Banshee.  


Was  it  possible  that  this  could  have  been  the  explanation?  Was  the  woman  in  the  field  trying  to  alert  me,  to  warn  me  about  the  impending  death  of  my  aunt?  


It  took  two  years  for  me  to  bring  this up  to  my  mother.  I  was  once  again  visiting  home,  and  we  were  drinking  tea  in  the  garden.  It  was  yet  another  summer  evening  at  twilight,  and  I  was  taken  back  to  that  night  by  the  bog.  I  voiced  my  memories  to  mum,  and  asked  her  if  she  remembered  what  the  constable  had  said.  


She  gazed  into  her  tea cup,  sighed  and  looked  up  at  me  slowly.  


""Yes  son,  I  remember.  Do  you  recall  me  telling  him  that  I thought  I  might  understand? ""  


""Yes  mum,  I  do.""  


""Your  dad  was  ready  to  question him.  Well,  this  might  sound  crazy  to  you,  but  I  did  understand.  You  see,  about  three  years  before  that  something  similar  had  happened.""  


I  took  an  intake  of  breath,  and  she  must  have  seen  my  eyes  widen.  


""Oh  no,  I  didn't  see  a  woman,  if  that's  what  you  think.  But  I  did  hear  a  cry  from  within  the  walls  of  our  old  home  on the  evening  your  granny  passed  away,  as  though  someone  was  screaming  deep  inside  the  house.  Of  course,  the  difference  is  that  we  were  prepared  that  time;  we  knew  it  was  only  a  matter  of  days,  or  hours.  But  I  did  hear  the  cry.  It  terrified  me  at  the time;  it's  part  of  the  reason  we  sold  up  and  moved  to  this  cottage.""  


I  was  dumbstruck.  When  I  finally  found  my  voice,  I  told  her  I  hoped  that  she  hadn't  come  to  hate  the  new  house  too  following  what  I  had  seen  two  years  before.  


""Oh  no,""  she  responded.  ""No,  I  actually  think  it's  helped  me  deal  with  the  first  occasion,  believe  it  or  not.  You  see,  I  think  maybe  it's  not  a  bad  thing.  She  was  distressed,  you  say,  when   you  saw  her  there.  The  woman  in  the  bog  I  mean.  Well,  perhaps  she  was  just  as  sad  as  we  were.  Perhaps  she's  just  part  of  the  family.  I  do  wonder  if  anyone  has  seen  or  heard  her  in  the  past.  Your  grandmother ...  well,  you  remember  her stories.  I  used  to  grimace  when  I  came  home  to  you  and  your  brother  shuddering  on  her  sofa.  I  still  stand  by  that!""  


She  smiled  wistfully  at  me  as  she  said  this,  and  I  was  transported  back  to  the  corner  of  the  old  sofa.  


""But  it  could  be  that  she  knew  there  was  some  truth  b ehind  what  she  was  saying.  Perhaps  your  grandmother -   my  mother  -  had seen  our  sad  friend  too.""  


With  that,  she  finished  her  tea,  lifted  both  cups  from  the  table  and  walked  to  the  sink,  leaving  me filled  with  thoughts,  nostalgia  and  an   overwhelming  sense  of  closeness  to  my  own  family,  culture  and  land  that  I  hadn't  felt  before.",13,51.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/113t123/the_banshee_in_the_bog/,False,2023-02-16 15:20:27,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

Turquoise_Mystique,None,False,False,False,113aayf,False,False,t3_113aayf,Ghost in Field,"Hi, so I'm not new to Reddit, but this is a new account. I've never posted here before though. iInhave a ghost encounter that some of you might find curious.

I live in quite a remote part of England, the peak district. My family owns a small farm here. As you can imagine at night it it's completely black outside but the skies can be amazing for stargazing because we live so far out and high up.

Anyway, this was about 5 years ago, I was looking out of my bedroom window (it faces onto the back of our farm, there's an indoor animal pen not far from the house in front, across the yard, then to the left we have a large field that is borded by a wooded area on the far side) and there is a glowing figure just stood at the very side of the field. It wasn't really bright and I almost missed it, but it was a human figure and it was just stood there looking up (not really at me though). I was quite freaked out and when I'm scared often I'll just freeze.. so I was staring at it for a good minute, but then I saw it fade away. It didnt walk away or anything like that, it literally faded. It was definitely not a reflection of any sort on the glass. To this day it still freaks me out so I keep my curtains closed whenever it's dark 😂",7,63.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/113aayf/ghost_in_field/,False,2023-02-15 22:21:41,False,False,False,0.98,,,,
mayihaveoats,None,False,False,False,113ectl,False,False,t3_113ectl,Two Experiences I Can't Wrap My Head Around!,"Hello! It's my first time using Reddit and making a post, but I've thought very long about sharing my ghost experiences online, as I've never really thought to tell other people about it other than my family and friends. I decided to get some input from others on my experiences and to sort of maybe feel like I'm not going crazy about what happened LOL. 

I have two experiences that happened on two separate occasions last year in my home a few months apart from each other. They're nothing too crazy, but I constantly think about them and try to wrap my head around what could've logically happened, but I just can't think of any. 

So around June/July last year, it was probably close to midnight and I was hungry for a snack. I tried to get my sister to go downstairs with me to the kitchen since I hate going alone but she refused and I went by myself. I am afraid of ghosts, but I've never had an experience or encounter in my home prior to this, so I thought there was nothing to be afraid of but I still had an uneasy feeling (the dark still creeps me out). To combat this feeling, I wore my wireless headset and left a stream on so I could distract myself while I made my snack. The volume was turned pretty low (generally have my computer volume set below 50% and the stream volume was even less than that) and I had the right side of my headphones tucked behind my ear to hear if a family member was coming. The stream would also cut in and out, since the connection doesn't quite fully reach the kitchen. 

I mention all this because as I was putting away stuff in the fridge I hear a CLEAR AS DAY ""Hey"" whispered into my right ear, the one with the headphone tucked behind it. Now, I'm one of those people where if something spooky happens, I try to ignore it and just let the feeling pass, which is what I did at first. I tried my ignoring tactic, thinking I was just imagining it, but I started getting chills and the hair on the back of my neck stood straight up and I just got an overwhelming feeling of fear. This reaction has never happened to me before when I've experienced other spooky things I've ignored. So I whip around, expecting to see someone that might've just snuck up on me or even an intruder for a quick second, scanning around to see if anyone might be there, and no one was. Now, that was my sign to GTFO, so I threw everything back in the fridge and took my snack and RAN. 

My second experience was similar, except I had my headset fully on. I was sitting at my desk doing schoolwork, and my desk is set up in a way where my back is facing the door. I had nothing playing through my headset and was just sitting there with them on and the door to my room was open. Suddenly I hear a loud ""Psssst"" come from the doorway, which is usually what my mom does when she tries to get my attention with my headphones on, so I thought nothing of it and I turned around expecting to see her standing in the doorway, only to find nobody there. Now, I would've just brushed this off as nothing, if my dog hadn't also turned to look at the door as it happened, as well. This freaked me out a little, as I realized my mom was still at work and no one could've just snuck up the stairs to prank me or anything, since my house is kind of old and the stairs are insanely loud. It's impossible to sneak up those stairs without hearing anyone coming up. I did use the ignore it tactic on this so I wouldn't get anymore freaked out than I already was LOL and just ignored that it even happened.  

I've thought about several factors that might've been the reasons for these, but I essentially debunked them all... Like, you could argue that maybe the ""hey"" was heard through my headphones, but I did a test and I can confirm I don't hear any audio when it's tucked behind my ear and it was exceptionally clear in only my right ear. I've thought how the ""psssst"" might've just been a family member downstairs and I just heard it from upstairs, but I can also confirm that my headphones do a pretty good job at blocking sound, especially if it were coming from all the way downstairs and this was also really close and clear. I've ruled out being tired since both times I was fully awake and I've also ruled out being in a bad mental state, as I was mentally sound during these occurrences, so I genuinely don't think I could've just been imagining it. But hey, I could be wrong on any of these.

Some other interesting things I might add are that my mom has said she's heard whispering while walking through the kitchen at night before and that my sister's friends have claimed to see the figure of a man in the kitchen sometimes. The voice I heard that whispered the ""hey"" to me was definitely a man's voice, as well. 

This might also be worth noting, but on the night of Mother's Day, me and my sister were up late making a gift for our mom, and around the times 2:55-3:00 AM, the doorbell rang. We ignored the first ring but then it rang a second time and our family got up to check both doors to see if anyone was outside, no one was. We also have a gate that's very noticeable when opened and closed that goes all the way around the house, so we would've heard someone open those (possible if it were a person they could've jumped the gate maybe). Only after this did those other spooky things happen to me, and now I got kind of worried that maybe when my family opened the doors that night we might've let something in...

But any thoughts? I've kept thinking about it and trying to brush it off as maybe I'm just crazy and imagined it, but these experiences have just stuck with me and I ponder about them a lot. 

TLDR: First experience: Went close to midnight for a snack in the kitchen alone, heard a loud ""hey"" whispered in my ear that caused me to get chills, the hair on my neck stood up, and I got an overwhelming sense of fear, which has never happened to me before. Second experience: Had headphones on, my back to the door, heard a loud and clear ""psssst"" thinking it was my mom from the doorway. Turned around and nobody was there. Dog also heard it and was also looking in the direction, as well.

According-Bat-1499,None,False,False,False,113br4b,False,False,t3_113br4b,I’ve had many experiences w ghosts,"I’ve had countless experiences with ghosts for the last 10ish years. I think I brought it into my life by constantly using a Ouija Board when I was in high school. Here are a couple :

1. When I was in high school I used to clean my uncles house for money when he was away at work. I always thought the house was really creepy and weird things would happen (my dog would get locked in a room, etc). I live in the North where it is pitch black in the winter months most of the time - I was finishing up cleaning for the day and was vacuuming and I looked up at the window in front of me and I saw a dark figure behind me in the hallway (the window was kind of like a mirror bc it was so dark outside). As soon as I squinted to try and see more clearly what it was, all the lights and power in the house shut off. The vacuum shut off, the lights. It was pitch black and silent. I ran outside down the street and didn’t look back. 

2. My most recent experience is this - 6 months to a year ago I started experiencing strange things happening in my apartment. Someone would knock on the door and I would open it and nobody was there, etc. One night my husband was out of town and I was sleeping in the apartment alone. I keep our bedroom door closed because our dog sleeps with us and I don’t want him roaming the apartment at night. I heard some weird noises in the living room but I tried not to think much of it because I was scared and just tried to fall asleep. Then I heard a light knock on my bedroom door. This freaked me out but I didn’t do anything and just ended up going to sleep (as I said above I’ve had countless experiences w ghosts so maybe I’m just used to it). In the morning I went to the living room and in the middle of the room on the ground was a perfectly straight fake vine laid out on the floor. For decor I had vines wrapped around the curtain rods. I have no explanation other than a ghost for this because to take these down you need to go on a ladder or chair and unravel these vines.",2,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/113br4b/ive_had_many_experiences_w_ghosts/,False,2023-02-15 23:24:19,False,False,False,0.89,,,,

Victorious_USA,None,False,False,False,112h4a7,False,False,t3_112h4a7,i played with a child’s ghost in the children’s hospital ER when i was 3,"when i was 3 or 4 i fell pretty violently down the staircase in my families’ old massachusetts victorian home and my parents took me to baystate children’s hospital one town over in springfield ma. i just had a busted lip from hitting the wall on the way down because it was one of those stair cases that turns and then continues downwards, but my parents were concerned i hit my head, so despite my crying and protesting at the idea of going to the “doctors,” they took me. i remember being absolutely terrified at the idea of possibly needing stitches in my lip so i cried the whole way there. the one good thing i remember about this place was the big playroom they had in the regular children’s hospital unit, however the children’s ER only had a few of those bead toys on a wooden box with the squiggly plastic bits to slide the beads on (i don’t know what they’re called). i sat down in front of the toy and started sliding the blocks and beads around the loops and turns of the plastic, then a boy started talking to me and when i looked up he was on the other side of the toy. i remember being taken aback as i’d never seen gore before. the most gore i had seen was when my parents were scrambling for the remote while we were watching the simpsons and “itchy & scratchy” came on. the side of the boy’s head was cracked completely open and as i took in his injury a strange scent hit me, sort of a sickly sweet smell but it was barely there if that makes sense. i was a very anxious child so i tried my hardest to hide my uneasiness, smiled at him, and continued to play. i remember he asked me, “what happened to you?” and i answered that i fell down the stairs. then i asked him, “how did you get your booboo?” gesturing towards my own head. he answered simply that he fell and we kept playing. at the time i thought he was a boy i knew from school, as he looked slightly similar (minus the cracked open head) so i felt comfortable with him after a few minutes. we chatted about how we were both afraid of being at the doctors and of being hurt from whatever the treatment would be. that’s pretty much the end of the memory, i got medicine on my lip and they checked my head to make sure it wasn’t hit during my fall. then a a month or so later there was a fire drill at my school. we were all lined up in the parking lot and i spotted the kid who i thought was the one in the ER with me but to my surprise his head was perfectly intact, not even stitches or a scar. his hair growth was also completely uninterrupted and i knew the doctors would shave down the hair to treat the wound. in that moment i basically just shrugged it off as my mistake, it wasn’t that kid. so finally, a few years ago when i was 20 i brought this memory up to my parents and they had no idea what i was talking about. they remembered my fall and the trip to the ER, me playing in the waiting room, but not any boy with a cracked open head playing along with me. they said if his head was as i described he would NOT be in the waiting room just hanging out. when they said that my adult brain processed the memory again and i was basically like oh yea what the fuck? then i remembered the smell that emanated from him as we talked and played. i kept trying to place it as the smell of infection or maybe just the dried out inside of his wound. but then i remembered where i smelled that before, just much much much more strongly. when i lived in okinawa japan as a preteen there were a ton of stray cats everywhere. one day i went on a walk with my class at my international school. it was in basically a rural japanese neighborhood with lots of farms around. as we walked up this one hill the boy leading us started gagging and groaning and the rest of us just laughed cause we thought he was either messing around or just being dramatic, but then the stench hit us. id never smelled death so strongly like that before and my eyes literally watered. we hesitantly made our way to the top of the hill in search of the source of the odor. we noticed a red stained bag hanging off low branch on a tree and the boy who originally smelled it quickly dashed over to peek into the bag and then ran back gagging. apparently there were 3 dead bloody cats stuffed into the grocery bag and unceremoniously hung up. it was through the memory of that smell that i identified what the scent of the boy in the ER was. it was the tangy sweet rotting smell of putrefying flesh, just like watered down so it was almost unnoticeable.",13,107.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/112h4a7/i_played_with_a_childs_ghost_in_the_childrens/,False,2023-02-14 21:47:47,False,False,False,0.97,,,,

I love the paranormal and have had a few experiences. I've seen a girls braids get pulled up by 'nothing'. CONTENT WARNING FOR THIS ONE(DEATH BLOOD ETC) 

When I was around 10:
I'd seen a door get pulled open after trying to open it multiple times where I saw a girl dead hanging by a noose dripping blood, the door slammed I went back to see what was rlly there and there was nothing there, there were 2 other ppl with me who also saw it. 

I'm an insomniac, when I was around 8 I had one of the deepest sleeps ever but got woken out of it by some sort of COLD wind it was around 3 am and at the time I lived in a country where it never got colder than like 15 degrees. Anyway I woke up suddenly and I saw something in the corner it was a shadowy figure and when I think ab it now it was very familiar and looked a lot like what I look like now, although it didn't have many features the body and hair type and all remind me of myself now. The figure came up to me and I thought it was my mum so I said hello?. It lifted its hand and it crawled on to the bed, its faced formed a sort of almost transparent mouth and it opened its mouth then disappeared almost INTO me I felt extremely cold then a warmth then nothing and I decided I was imagining things. When I woke up there was water on my floor, even tho I had no bottles of water in my room and it was the middle of a drought so it couldn't be flooding. 

I'm mentally ill, I think I have BPD so I get scared alot of this stuff is paranoia/mania or stuff I imagine. But I have heard humming, singing etc multiple times when I've been completely alone. I have many periods of times where I ONLY dream ab dead ppl or have th exact same dream again and again. Or see visions in my head of the dream even when I'm awake. I am a huge empath for ppl who r alive and generally, theres been multiple times where I've been near places where ppl have died and felt rlly overwhelmed and cried and stuff even before I knew it was anything to do with the dead. Also when I watch or hear ab paranormal things sometimes I start to feel dizzy, extremely angry, sad etc . But latley I've been having random chest pain, back pain. I have been to the doctor but there's nothing that could cause that. I've also been feeling as if something is coming for me or warning me. I feel like I'm kinda going crazy 🥰🥰😽😽. 

Anyway I think I need to investigate or just close myself off from the paranormal until I rlly know I can have control.",4,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/112sjym/i_think_i_have_an_attachment/,False,2023-02-15 07:43:26,False,False,False,0.75,,,,

At the end of September, my Nana who I️ was extremely close with and loved very very much passed on. Fast forward to December, I️ had moved into my first apartment. We had talked many times about me moving and she was excited for me to get it. Anyways, nothing unexplained or weird happened until last night. I️ came home from the gym around 3 pm, I️ was having a rough day and was on the phone with my mom. I️ had gone into my bedroom in and out several times. My bed was made and nothing was on it.  Around 5 pm ish, I️ started to wind down and got my shower. I️ come back into my room and sit on the edge of my bed, moisturizing etc. I️ put on my pajamas and walk to my bathroom for maybe 3-5 minutes MAX. Mind you, I️ had no music on or anything it was silent. I️ come back into my bedroom and the work clothes I️ changed out of HOURS ago were sitting on my bed. I️ know for a fact I️ put them in the hamper in the closet next to my bed. I️ was shocked because I️ knew they weren’t there before because I️ was just sitting in that exact spot! Plus I️ had already put my gym clothes in the hamper after my shower so if I️ did leave my work clothes out, I️ would’ve put them in the hamper as well. It was just such a weird feeling knowing that it wasn’t me, I️ live alone btw. Checked everywhere for an imaginary intruder. I️ was just stunned. I️ said hello and if it was my Nana that I️ love her but if not that I’m friendly and don’t mean any harm. Nothing weird the rest of the night and I️ slept fine, no bumps in the night.

Cityboyaugust,None,False,False,True,111lun2,False,False,t3_111lun2,Has any one ever seen this Strange demonic cloaked entity,"When I was a kid, about 7 years old I remember me and my sister were playing at some play ground park maybe around like 8ish 9ish(my mom used to love to go out with her friend to random places to gossip, yeah idk) as the night wore on I noticed something dark with a cloak on immersing out of complete darkness. It came from basically the desert as I used to live in a small town near death valley. As I was studying it, it looked and moved just like the reaper it even had the same satchel thing and it didn’t seem to be interested in me or anyone It just walked in a straight line almost floating. I told my sister and we ran away. That was the first time I seen this being, the second time I seen it was when I moved with my father far away from any desert. My father is a born an again Christian he even was a certified pastor for many years and had his own church. Well one day, I remember him and his friend were practicing music for the church which I pleasantly sat and listened to when all of a sudden I felt something was watching me so I sat in the corner of the living room and i had a clear view of a door that used to be the entrance to a room we had in the far back, as I looked up i automatically noticed that the middle of the curtain that we used to have on the door was being lifted up as if someone was behind there  holding it up. I stared for what seemed an eternity I was confused because no one was back there and I could see nothing but what seemed like pure darkness with a slight round outline of a head. After a few seconds it dropped and I rushed to go investigate yet nothing was back there. Fast forward to present time a couple days ago I had 2 dreams back to back of this dark cloaked entity stalking me in a strange house I forgot what the dream was about I just remember seeing the demonic being and thinking “ahh you again”. The morning I woke up from the second dream I swear I seen this dark cloaked entity standing besides my bed staring at me and disappeared almost immediately. I have no clue who this demon is I don’t know why it’s so attached to me obviously following me since I was a child until now. I don’t know what it’s purpose is I’m just very confused.

legallyjennifer,None,False,False,False,110a60r,False,False,t3_110a60r,Unforgettable hotel experience,"this happened 4 years ago, i got a scholarship to go study aboard but before going me and people who joined the same organization for a scholarship had to go through a camp and do all icebreaking things together. it was held in an old hotel. I got into all activities and made friends. At the evening of the first day, the roommate names of everyone was annoynced, i was paired up witha girl who iwasn’t close with but that wasn’t an issue. I was the first one who got into the room while my roomate was in other group still doing her acitivities.
The first minute i got into the room, a bizzare smell i still dont know how to explain til thesedays kicked in hard. I felt something was off. I just dragged all my luggages in and surveyed around. The more i stayed in that room, the more i felt uncomfortable. I tried to ignore my intuition and got on the phone. The unexplainable pressure was all around, i didn’t feel a good vibes in that room at all and the silence was actually unbearable for some reasons though usually i really like the silence. The sudden knock on my door got me flinched, however, i got up and opened the door anyways, it was my bestfriend that i just knew on that day, we became so close so quick during activities and all that. She looked into the room for a while until she snapped out and asked me if i want to go out for a dinner with her and 3 more friends. I said yes and during the time i was walking out i met with my roommate then we exchanged our number and everything then i went for a dinner with my groupf of friends. Not only 10 minutes past i just got out from a hotel, my roommate who i just exchanged the number to screamed from on top of the lung instantly after i picked up the call, all she said was i will not stay here, move your stuff too quickly then hung up. I was so confused. A friend, the same one who went up to my room and asked me said ‘i think i know what you meant’. And me, who tried to ignore my intuition for hours because i didn’t want to freak out start putting all jigsaws together started to get really scared but i tried to hold it in and asked all my friends to help me move for obvious reasons, obviously, i didnt want to go in that room alone (lol). We cameback in the hotel and went to my room. The weird feeling that i felt the first time i came in was back. But i didnt care much i just tried to get my stuff out as soon as possible. I moved to my friends room and all of us decided that we all gonna sleep together. 
I held my curiosity in and didnt tell anyone else about the scream my roommate did because i tried not to scared them. ‘We should tell stories about something horror’, one of my friends said and others agreed saying it is a good time to since there are a lot of people in that room. Only me and my other friend, the same one who asked me if i wanted to go for dinner and looked ino my old room were quiet but still didnt say anything and just went along whatever. My friends started telling the stories and taking turns as we sit in a circle. All of sudden, banging on the window got us screamed and we got up and ran into different directions as it was so loud. My specific friend that was often mentioned just yelled ‘we’re sorry it’s enough’ while the banging doesnt stop, it went from the window to other sides of walls too. One of my friends who is clueless just said it’s probably come from the trees and whatever, but at the moment we all knew damn well it wasn’t. The knocking was going on for almost 5 minutes then just got quiet. And of course, we ended up not getting any sleep for that night. (Who would have a nerve for that..)
In the morning, we started other activities and i finally encountered with my old roommate who still looked scared and tired. She pulled out of the place and stopped at the lobby like she was trying to avoid someone hearing about it.
‘When you weren’t there because you went out for a dinner, i was alone so i just casually took a bath and did my things. I just tried to brush my hair in front of the mirror that they had in the room, there was a woman combing my hair from behind as well by her rotten hand and laughed with such a sound that i would never forget.. like hehehe..’ Suddenly, i’m sure we both here the same hehehe came from some bacony of higher floors hallway. At that moment, i knew exactly what it sounded like. We stopped conversation there. She ended up feeling sick and had high fever so she couldn’t keep up with all the rest activities.
3-4 years passed by, me and my specific friend got a chance to talk again and we talked about things that happened many years ago. She just started the topic with, ‘do you know what i saw in your room that day’. I just shaked my head. ‘A woman with a blood all over her face and body, only color she had in her eyes was pitch black. She was levitating outside the 7th floor window and smiled at me also she had such a scary laugh, i think she was the one who knocked our window and walls as well…’",5,31.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/110a60r/unforgettable_hotel_experience/,False,2023-02-12 07:41:44,False,False,False,0.85,,,,
ComprehensiveTale882,None,False,False,True,11044u9,False,False,t3_11044u9,First experience in a new space.,"I've had experiences with ghosts or similar things most of my life. In my Dad's childhood home my older sister and I would run and frantically try to flip on the light switches to the kitchen and dining room. There was a black mass that would move from the den to the dining room vice versa. And my Dad had his own experiences. Such as my sister probably 2 or 3 at the time asking who the green man was at the end of the hall. Then at my mother's house my sister could never shut her own closet door. If she did, something went crazy. Throwing stuff around the closet and ripping clothes down. She kept her mattress on the ground so it couldn't hide under her bed. This activity stopped after my grandmother passed away in the home. As a teenager we rented an old mill house in town. I had a radio that started turning on by itself. (It never did this in any other house.) So I unplugged it and it still turned one. Whatever it was liked to scared me with the radio. Turning on as soon as I reached the counter or went to bed. It even did this with my friends over. One night my friend said hey there's something over there with you! (A dark shadow was standing by the book case next to the couch. I jumped up to sit with her on the love seat. The large cup of tea I had set on the floor next to the couch was now pressed up against the top of the arm of the chair. When we both saw this, it crashed to the floor. We ran out of the house. I also had scratching in my closet. Recently my family have moved into my dad's house. (Not his childhood home) My dad hasn't had any experiences in this house. The other day, I woke up and went to the hall bathroom (which is tiled.) My dad's bathroom is on the other side of the wall. As I walked in, it sounded like someone held something glass above their head and slammed it down into the tile next to me as hard as they could. I felt the impact through my feet. The vibrations were so strong. The shattering sound was so loud my husband heard it in the bedroom. That evening I asked my Dad if anything fell in his bathroom.  (The only explanation I would have for this.) Nothing fell. Nothing was moved. Some how that seems worse than if something were to have broke as soon as I entered the room. And no I wasn't stomping. I don't know what to think or do. Before that happened I was feeling uncomfortable when I would go to sleep alone. Like something might peek around the corner. Or something might be in the room with me. And now the feeling is worse.

No one was expecting her to pass away the day she did, it all happened very fast. We’d had a tumultuous relationship, amongst other things she stopped saying “I love you” back to me. I’d tried twice in the run up to her death, the last time I spoke to her was through text, I’d decided to not bother saying “I love you” anymore as it hurt to not hear it back. I feel immense guilt over not just saying it to her one more time.
Fast forward to today, I went and viewed her body, as it’s her funeral Monday. Just to preface this, I have never believed in anything paranormal. I’ve always been very certain you die and that’s it. 
The woman that worked there said she’d stay with me a couple minutes to make sure I was okay, as unfortunately there were obvious signs of decomposition. Nothing odd happened in the those two minutes, she left. I then stood next to my Nan in silence for a couple minutes not sure what to say. So I just blurted out “hi nanna”. The light above my head flickered, oh just weird wiring I thought. I said “I love you and I miss you”, it flickered again. I stood there silently crying for a couple more minutes, the lights didn’t flash. Then I said “I’m so sorry I was such a shitty granddaughter, I’m keeping my promise and wearing your necklace everyday”. The lights flickered again. That’s when I started wondering if it was her trying to talk back to me. I stood there silently for a few more minutes. I asked “are you here with me?” The lights flickered again. Then I said “I hope you are okay, wherever that is”. More flickering lights. I stroked her hair for a couple minutes and gave her forehead a kiss then I said “I’m going to leave now, love you.” The lights flickered again. 
It’s worth mentioning that the light fitting had 4 bulbs in it and all four were flickering. This was spread out over 30 minutes. Emotionally I have no idea how to process this. Single handedly the most bizarre experience of my life, that was so cathartic. I was nervous going in to the room as the woman who worked there warned me that she was in bad condition. But as soon as I walked in the room with her, I felt totally fine.

ArcticFoxOfTheNorth,None,False,False,True,10yqe93,False,False,t3_10yqe93,My three ghost experiences.,"Heyyoo. So I’ve wanted somewhere to share my experiences, and just now found this sub. My encounters with ghosts have all been pretty short (so far) so I thought I’d just put them all into one post. To this day I am convinced that my workplace is haunted.


I had my first encounter while at work one evening. It was a little late, and a coworker and I were staying behind to clean up after the others had left for the day (which is something we do regularly). I was going about my business and cleaning up, but when we were done and heading back to the sluice, my coworker (and BFF) noticed I had a pretty large oil stain in the shape of hand print on my upper back. At first I was suspicious of my coworker, thinking that she had placed her hand on my back, but we later compared her hand to the hand in my back and her hand was too small. Thinking back on it, I never felt anyone put their hand on my back while I was working. That, and the stain was so visible, if someone HAD actually had their hand on my back, they would’ve needed to keep it there for a while, and while I was moving about. I find this pretty freaky, I still have no clue where it came from or how it got there.


My second (and most recent) encounter happened 2 days ago. The weather was pretty bad and the power ended up going out, halting production. The foremen and assistant foremen told us to go wait in the sluice, but it got a bit crowded so we eventually shuffled into the cafeteria. My best friend and I were made to go clean up like usual, but since it was almost pitch black, we couldn’t see shit and thus only finished off with all the machines the best we could. When we got back into the sluice, we both saw someone standing by the racks where we usually hang our work clothes, but when we got around the corner and out from behind one of the shoe racks, there was no one there. We looked into the foreman’s office that is attacked to the stairwell, and we looked into the other sluice that is right besides the one we use, but no one was there. The weirdest part is that we both saw two different ghosts. I saw a short and stubby one while my best friend saw a tall and lanky one. By far the weirdest experience I’ve had so far.


Edit because I forgot one story:

So the one I forgot about happened a while ago. I was visiting my best friend and were watching the Conjuring (as you do). She had turned on some candles for a subtle ambience. Well, while we were watching the movie, one of the candles she lit almost went out while the other one was standing perfectly still. What I find scary is that the candle only moved whenever something happened on screen. This candle was on a shelf, mind you. I got so creeped out that I eventually just blew out the candle. Something I should note is that my best friend has an attachment (her words, not mine), and now I’m pretty sure something has latched into me as well. Her house has this old sword that she says has the souls of all its victims trapped inside, even the original owner of the sword. She has experienced way more spooky shit than I have, and thus has more authority on this particular subject than I do. But nevertheless, it is kinda scary (although she has assured me that the ghosts at her home aren’t harmful, but they do like to mess around).",19,56.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10yqe93/my_three_ghost_experiences/,False,2023-02-10 12:09:34,False,False,False,0.94,,,,

Which I got note the hallway 2 doors in it. One on the left was mine. And at the end was my parents and my 1 year old sister. Anyway, I looked out the doorway of my room. It was open like it usually is. When I see a grayish blue tall figure walking down the hallway scratching on the wall. It then stopped and looked at me. It had no features. Just nothing. I was scared. But I coudent move. It then turned back and continued walking down the hallway. Towards my family room. And for some reason, I jumped out of my bad and ranned as fast as my little legs could. I recall not seeing it when I went into the hallway. But i still ran to my parents room and waking them up. And then I told them about what happen. I think they would of thought I had a nightmare if I wasent so terrified. I was working about them.

allgoodthings96,None,False,False,True,10xmmke,False,False,t3_10xmmke,A Happy Paranormal Experience,"This happened to my Mom so it’s not really my story to tell but it left a great impact on me. 

Growing up my Mom had a childhood best friend who lived next door. My Mom was an only child and her friend had a big family so she would always go over to play. When they became teenagers they did begin to drift apart but throughout the years their closeness would come and go in waves. My Mom always loved her and considered her a big sister. She was the Maid of Honor at my Mom’s wedding and they always had love for each other. 

Throughout life my Mom’s friend would go through various jobs and boyfriends and living situations and every time she and my Mom caught up she’d say, “This is the best I have ever been. I know I said it before but this time I really mean it.” 

My Mom’s friend past suddenly at 36 from cancer. She said the last conversation they had was over the phone when she told her the sad news. They both agreed that later that fall they would do the breast cancer walk together. She died shortly after. Obviously, my Mom was devastated. I was just a kid but I will never forget seeing her cry that way. 

My Mom told me she went to a medium a couple months after the death because she was looking for closure. She won’t tell me everything that was discussed but she did say that when she asked the medium to ask her if she was at peace the medium told her, verbatim and unprompted, that she said, “This is the best I have ever been. I know I said it before but this time I really mean it.”",11,124.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10xmmke/a_happy_paranormal_experience/,False,2023-02-09 05:35:30,False,False,False,0.99,,,,

paranormah,None,False,False,False,10v5843,False,False,t3_10v5843,the white-eyed child,"There are a few warnings I want to get out of the way before I tell this story. First, there are mentions of suicide -- I don't go into detail, just out of respect for the individual involved and their family. Second, I will also be talking about depression and anxiety. This story is extremely dark but also terrifying. I have never had something like this happen again, thank goodness.

To begin, I need to tell you what exactly a white-eyed child is; there's not a lot of information about them, but from the research I've done, they're messengers of death -- another name for them is angels of death. A lot of elderly people tend to see them right before they die. It is also said that if you see one, it means either you or someone you know is about to pass on. At the time of the sighting, I had no knowledge about these children or their meanings. I didn't connect the dots until later on -- the dots being seeing the child and then the death that followed.

So, a little backstory. I got a job at this retirement home after I had to move out of my parent's house at the age of 18. Finding employment was proving difficult, so my best friend's mother, Lola, did me a solid and got me a job at the place she worked. The building was old; it was formerly a train station before it was converted into a retirement home. Since it was where many people lived for the remainder of their lives, there were a lot of deaths over the years, which meant there were shadow figures. I remember asking my co-worker about them, and she said it wasn't uncommon to spot one in the corner of your eye. She told me not to worry about it; they were harmless. That was about the extent of the paranormal activity I had encountered.

However, while working there, I had some severe anxiety. Something I had *never* suffered from before -- it probably didn't help that the environment was pretty toxic; the boss was sexist, and the kitchen was filled with middle-aged women with nothing better to do than gossip. Now, it wasn't my first time working in a less-than-ideal place. But at my old job -- which just so happened to be Wal-Mart -- I never felt anxiety like this; it was always dread. I actually had my first anxiety attack working at that retirement home; it was scary and out of the blue, probably one of the worst experiences of my life, and I never had anxiety again after I left.

Anyway, the day I saw the white-eyed child was just a regular work day. I worked as a dishwasher, but I also helped prep -- mainly peeling potatoes and helping with other little things. So, I was on my way to the pantry to grab something when this little girl popped up in front of me. It startled me so badly that I stopped dead in my tracks, half-expecting to mow a little girl down. But she was gone just as soon as she appeared. I remember glancing around the kitchen, seeing if my other co-workers spotted the little girl. But they were all carrying on with their tasks as if nothing had happened. I recall some of her details -- she wore a white, olden-day dress, blonde pigtails, a white nightcap, and white eyes. I might've only seen her for a millisecond, but I'll never forget how her eyes had no irises or pupils.

To describe dish-pit, it was in the shape of the u. Beside my workstation was a door that led out to the dining room -- the door had a small window (this is important to the story). These large windows in the dining room overlooked the street in front of the building. It was around 2 pm when I spotted red and blue flashing lights in that little window. My co-worker came in shortly after in tears, I asked her what was wrong, and she informed me a resident had taken their life. For some reason, I decided to walk out of the kitchen to see that the entire street was *filled* with fire trucks, ambulances, and police. Again, I won't go into detail, but I will say it was horrible.

I knew who the resident was; they were kind, they were caring, and they were a wonderful human being. Their passing weighed heavily on us all, making working at that place even harder. I'm unsure how to describe this next part, but the atmosphere felt... heavy, not sad, but evil. I know I sound insane, but it was like on top of being sad for our friend, it was also like something had taken up residence in that building -- like it was feeding off of our misery. There were a lot of deaths following this passing -- a lot of health problems, and even the employees were suffering from the effects.

I fell into a deep depression that I'm still suffering from, although that has been something I've been struggling with for a while. Anyway, that is the story of the white-eyed child. It's incredibly dark and does not have a happy ending, but I will never forget it. I will say that if you or someone you know is suffering, please reach out. I know I sound like a broken record, but from one broken person to another, you're not alone, and more importantly, don't be ashamed of reaching out. You're not weaker for admitting you need help; you're a heck of a lot stronger for it.

JaySunshine21,None,False,False,False,10tyr68,False,False,t3_10tyr68,Masking," Hello, I recently went over to a friend's house to investigate some phenomena's that have been happening at her apartment. She thinks it has been her Nona, but I warned her it could be something else. I walked in brought my spirit box and sls camera, there was definitely someone there, but I couldn't make out if it was a good or bad spirit. As I was explaining what the devices were my friend was about to say her Nona's name, but I warned her to stop. If you come across a spirit and its acting friendly, someone who lost someone would think ""oh! it's my grandfather"" or something along those lines. You never want to say the person you lost name, or even think it, other spirits can blurt out that exact name and pretend to be the person close to you, but really, they are not friendly and will attach or drain your energy.  After I told her this, I told her a story about MY great grandfather, specifically stating their name. Three minutes later, I ask if the person in the room with us what is your name? "" Albert"" my great grandfathers name, I looked at her and I said there is your evidence right there. How do I know that that's not my gg? He and I are not on speaking terms, we got into a little fight he went away for a while, so I knew it could not. 

Also, some of you might think oh, it could actually be the spirits name- the way it was said and how it continued with the conversation based on what I told my friend about my gg I definitely knew it was not. So, please be careful what you say out loud, or think next time you are trying to communicate with spirits. A better thought would be ""May I have your name"" ""Can I ask who I am speaking to?"" something along those lines.

For context this was around the late 80s in the UK and my dad was visiting a place called Chillingham Castle for a school trip, as some of you may or may not know, castles around the UK are known for being quite haunted and Chillingham is not an exception. However the experience my dad had is quite different to anything I’ve heard of before. 

There is a courtyard in the centre of the castle and my dads tour group had been shown around it previously and had begun to move on to another area of the castle, however my dad had managed to misplace his hat and assumed that he’d left it in the courtyard. After telling his teacher, he split off from the group to return to the courtyard and entered it, he quickly spotted his hat on the ground and grabbed it. But when he raised his head up to stand, the courtyard walls were coated completely in dark red blood. The blood oozed down the walls slowly and quite literally was everywhere on every single wall, even the windows. Obviously terrified he ran straight out of the courtyard and back to the tour group as fast as possible and told a few of his mates but none of them believed him. The group briefly passed near the courtyard again and when my dad looked all the blood had disappeared completely.

He said that he swears to this day it happened but has no idea how or why. Does anyone know of any similar stories?",19,54.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10tgdyt/bleeding_castle_walls/,False,2023-02-04 13:27:05,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

Seconds before my aunt passed away she looked into the corner of the room quizzically and in a confused tone, called out her recently deceased sons name.

campspooki_podcast,None,False,False,False,10t1m9i,False,False,t3_10t1m9i,A playmate from the other side," **Hello there! Excuse my typos but I'm just excited to join a paranormal community!**

For context, I'm an only child. My 1st encounter was when I was 5 years old in my bedroom. My bedroom was located in the far part of the house. Of course, my bedroom was pretty much secluded! My bed was one of those old spring mattresses that made sounds every time you moved. And was placed against the wall in the far corner of my room. ***\*\*remember these details for later\*\****

**Mysterious Indent**

To set the scene it was the night before my 1st day of kindergarten and I was awake late at night. Not from excitement just because I had insomnia before my parents even knew. It was around 3 AM and I was watching adult swim (my parents were pretty much hippies so practically no restrictions on tv) lol and while I'm laying down I hear my mattress creaking. I just remember thinking that it was odd because I didn't move at all to make a noise. Without moving I shift my eyes down to the end of my mattress to see a literal indentation on the edge. A BUTT INDENT! You would think being a 5-year-old girl I would've been so scared and run to my parent's bedroom. WRONG. I don't know why, but I wasn't scared. I was chill and figured whoever/whatever this thing was just liked watching tv too.

I realized that after a couple of episodes of family guy, I should probably get to sleep before school and I sat up, looked at the indent in my bed, and said ""I need to go to bed for school in the morning, you can stay if you want, but I have to turn the tv off."" The indent slowly lifted as if they were getting up from my bed and I felt its presence disappear. So what did I do? Welp as an unbothered 5-year-old I went to sleep and had that night in the back of my head.

I didn't know what a ghost or anything paranormal was. I know a few weeks passed and I hadn't seen it since but I started to sleepwalk after that night. I'd sleepwalk everywhere in the house, but I frequently would sleepwalk into my parent's room, open their closet door, enter, and face toward their bed. Don't ask me why because I didn't even know this occurred until family members and my parents would ask me. I was very small and had hair that went past my butt. I was giving Cousin IT/grudge vibes for sure. My Tia even said that one time she slept over at our house and remembers waking up to me facing toward her while she slept on the couch.

**Playdates in the dark**

Although this would occur when I was asleep, during the daytime I would come home from school and be babysat by my grandparents in the afternoon and my younger cousin would be dropped off a few hours later. Usually, I would stay away from the back of the house until it was time to sleep. One day I was going to use the restroom and the only sunlight that lit the hallway would come from the bottom of the door. As I walk down the hallway I see a shadow as if it stepped in front of the door. I knew this wasn't anyone in my household because my grandparents were usually busy in the front of the house. I calmly made a U-turn and forgot about having to pee.

I thought that if this thing wasn't going anywhere then maybe we could be friends and play! Could you tell I am an only child lol? I'd close all the doors in the hallway and sit by my parent's door with my Simba stuffed animal that also rattled, ask to play with me, slide my Simba to the opposite end and it would slide back to me!!! I was so excited to have a friend to play with. This happened up until I moved to California with my mom. I never told anyone about my ""friend"". Later to learn that my uncle slept in my room around the world cup games and my ""friend"" spooked my uncle out 3 times within a couple of hours.

Ever since then when I visit my dad in TX I don't feel welcomed in my room. I'm not sure why but it feels like I'm being watched and overall in a bubble. And what's even more messed up is that my Simba has disappeared and it's nowhere to be found. And I still sleepwalk. I'm 22 years old now.

Since my 1st paranormal encounter, I've experienced so many paranormal encounters to the point where I can at times see and hear people who aren’t there, things flying across rooms in a home I grew up in, and so much more.

One your I saw something I can’t explain. Years went by an I brought it up to my mom and grandma and they looked at each other and said “They Can’t hurt you” really freaked me out. Was expecting them to deny or say something more comforting lol. Then it happen to my sister. I’m the oldest brother or 3 sisters an I’m very perfective of them. And honestly I believe more in logic but I just don’t know. 

We experienced things moving, lights flickering, doors and cabinets opening in the weirdest ways, but most of all we’d see a figure hovering over us while we sleep. Those are as clear as day, the most horrific feeling of being frozen an witnessing something like that is UNDENIABLE. 

We tryn and debunk most of everything but that will shut you up. 

So I have a question for you guys.
I see these TikToks an top 5s and honestly I don’t believe in 1 single video. Nothing it drives me crazy. I want to believe but come on. Ppl are really ruining this. They say “you be the judge” i mean how hard they try. I do video editing for a living and I’d never fake something like that for views.

So I want to ask you guys, is there a video out there that you 100% believe in. I mean undeniably honest video evidence, no bullsh*t. I’d love to see. I believe and have witnessed, but from what I’ve seen angers me.

mortyclone1,None,False,False,False,10s6j4b,False,False,t3_10s6j4b,Menacing Memory,"I was about 15 years old, living in a rented house with my mum. My bedroom was at the front of the house and my bed had two mattresses on it (a spring mattress on the bottom and a soft foam mattress on the top). My bed was positioned on the outer corner wall, under the window.  I woke up one night for no particular reason, but felt uneasy in this 'heavy quiet' sensation. In the corner of the room, diagonally opposite my bed in the corner of the inner walls of the room, something was clinging to the ceiling and walls. It was almost completely transparent, but the light was distorted (bending) around the curvatures and edges of it's form. It was humanoid in shape but devoid of features. It hung there in the top right hand corner of the opposite wall as if it had it's back pressed into the corner, and it's feet and hands were up beside it's body (sort of like how Spiderman might hang in such a spot, though I'm not sure I'd seen any Spiderman content, this was 20 years ago and I did not read comics).   
It had been there watching me sleep. When it saw I was awake, is started moving along the top of the far wall, closer to my bed. Then, it started moving along the ceiling towards me. It didn't move it's limbs. It was more like it hovered along it's path. I was paralysed with fear and my heart was racing. This thing came across the ceiling until it was directly above me, and then slowly descended down over me, and my mattress sunk down with the weight of it where it's limbs pressed down into the mattress on both sides of me as if it was on all fours, leaning down into my face. All I could do was squeeze my eyes shut, and turn my face away, screaming in my head over and over again for this thing to go away! Only a few moments later, everything returned to normal. I heard ambient sound return (waves from the nearby ocean, and the wind outside). I could pull my blanket up, so it mustn't have been on my bed anymore. Without even opening my eyes (I didn't want to see if it was still there), I pulled the blanket up over my head and stayed there under the blanket. My mum's cat (who doesn't like me) came and hopped up onto my bed and laid down on my chest to sleep which was unusual.  
This bares a lot of the hallmarks of sleep paralysis and as an adult, I found out my brother suffered with sleep paralysis a lot as child, but didn't know what was happening. This whole experience was extremely vivid and malevolent though and to this day, it's kept me guessing about what happened that night.

ChronicAuthoritis,None,False,False,False,10rto23,False,False,t3_10rto23,"I heard her say ""Uh-oh.""","So this, much like my incident with the ghost of the civil war nurse, isn’t going to be some grand epic, it isn’t going to be some ‘and then I saw the ghost’ type thing. I honestly wish it was, as those things make for better retellings, and they’re harder to dispute. 

Anyway, for a bit of backstory, I live in a small southern city, with history dating back to the Civil War, the apartment building I call home, and have called home for almost four years now, was built in 1936 to be apartments, instead of existing as a house first only to then be converted into apartments. The walls and floors in this place are tremendously paper thin, as I can hear my downstairs neighbor’s T.V and my downstairs neighbor if she’s talking loud enough. There’s squirrels in the walls that I can hear scrabbling from time to time, and I can hear every time the front door opens and shuts, generally because people slam it. 

I say all that to say, yes, I know there’s rational, logical explanations for all sorts of things. I’m sure there’s a logical explanation for the heavy footsteps I sometimes hear in my downstairs neighbor’s apartment, which sounds like she puts on her heaviest pair of hiking boots (which I would be surprised if she owns) and paces, doing her best to stomp heavily with every step. I’m sure there’s a logical explanation for the knocking I’ll hear sometimes on the bathroom wall, which sounds very much like my other neighbor is rapping his knuckles against his side of the wall. I’m even sure there’s a logical explanation for the shadow of the arm I’m sure I saw in my dark kitchen once and only once back in 2020, staring at it as I was from the living room.. I’m sure there’s a logical explanation for any and all little creepy things that have happened while I’ve lived here. 

I can find no explanation for this next part. 

This was about a week ago. I was about to go to sleep, sitting on the couch (I sleep on my couch because the living room is the only room I can somewhat climate control, be it through heaters or fans) and playing some solitaire to sort of relax. It was a particularly noisy evening that night, the train was whistling and groaning as it made its way down the tracks, the squirrels were scrabbling in the walls, and I could hear one of my neighbors moving around. In truth I was a little unnerved by all the noise, but then, in the midst of everything else, I hear it. 

“Uh-oh.” 

It was a small voice, toneless, either a young woman or a child. It wasn’t muffled, didn’t sound like it was coming from a T.V or from one of my neighbors. It sounded like it was coming from the kitchen or my bedroom. I stop, paralyzed, listening, and hear nothing else. Ever since then, I’ve heard nothing else, and have no explanation for it. There’s no grand ghost story attached to this place, the only thing that comes close being a half-remembered story from the old landlord about some little girl going missing here at some point. (Even he hadn’t heard about it himself, had only heard about it from a woman doing research for a ghost walk). It could be nothing, and I probably won’t ever hear anything else, just like the civil war nurse at my college, but I know what I heard, I know what it wasn’t even if I don’t know what it was.

ChronicAuthoritis,None,False,False,False,10rui92,False,False,t3_10rui92,Weeping Woman,"So, I’ve mentioned before how my town has a lot of Civil War history. This is despite the small hangup that only a few buildings actually managed to survive the war. The rest were torn down to build barricades along the river, as the town itself changed hands on more than one occasion. One of the few remaining buildings in question is an old bank, technically the oldest in the state, though not the oldest operating one. It was built in 1833, though almost immediately went bankrupt, the now bankless bank serving as everything from a private residence to a hospital during the war before finally managing to actually be used as a bank again, though even that wouldn’t last very long. 

Its a museum now, and one not too far removed from where I live, close enough that I’ll walk to it sometimes. I’m friendly with the people who run it, and have given some tours to friends who I’ve dragged down there. 

There’s a few ghost stories associated with the bank, though arguably the most famous is that of the weeping woman, a woman who had one son go fight for the north, and the other for the south. Both boys ended up dying, and though they died on different days, in different battles, news reached the woman of their deaths on the same day. There’s a mirror in the downstairs portion of the bank that’s actually originally from the bank when it first was built. Its used a lot now for prom and wedding pictures, and supposedly every once in a while, a picture’ll get ruined by the addition of a person in the mirror, a woman dressed all in black. 

I wish I could say that I have a picture of the woman, and that this story is about the circumstances around that picture, but, unfortunately, I don’t. There is another part of that ghost story though, that sometimes the woman can be heard weeping over the deaths of her sons. I was in the museum about four months ago, showing it to a friend of mine, and had dropped back while the lady who normally oversaw it was explaining something to another couple of guests. I’m standing there, listening, and then I hear it. 

It sounded distinctly like a woman openly weeping, coming from somewhere just a little ways away. I thought it might have been outside, but then someone opened the door, and the noise didn’t get any louder. Glancing over at my friend, it was clear he didn’t hear anything, and, after a while, the noise went away. No one else in that building heard it, though the lady in charge had told me several stories about unusual things happening to her, plates breaking, small noises, all sorts of things. 

A couple months pass, and then during a Christmas celebration at the Bank, I heard the woman telling the story of the weeping woman to a couple people who had asked about ghosts. I got to be part of that story, as I leaned in and told them that I myself had heard it. I’ve yet to hear it again even as I’ve gone back to try, but I know what I heard. There is a ghost story around that old bank, and I am now part of it.

ChronicAuthoritis,None,False,False,False,10ru33j,False,False,t3_10ru33j,I Heard the Sound of a Crash,"So, this is admittedly a little shaky, and there’s probably a logical explanation for this, but I think it’s interesting, especially given *where* I heard it. 

As stated in several of my other posts, I live in a small southern city with a lot of Civil War history. About two months ago, I set out to put together a book of the city’s ghost stories as—at least to my knowledge—no one else has done so. This has led to a lot of on foot research, a lot of questions, and one or two mistakes (my sincerest apologies to the one store, when I told you your place was haunted, I hadn’t realized I was in the wrong place). 

One of the more prevalent ghost stories I’ve come across, so far as everybody seems to know some version of it, is that of a little girl who fell through a skylight of a grocery store in the 1930s, hit her head on a coke machine, and died the next day. It’s one of the few ghost stories I’ve come across for the book that’s rooted in history, as the little girl did actually fall, I’ve seen a photograph of her, I’ve read newspaper articles about it, and I’ve visited her grave. A lot of the finer points of the actual event seem to have gotten mixed up in the retelling of it, though, as I’ve heard people talk about the little girl falling through a window instead of a skylight, and pointing to other buildings on the street as the one she’d fallen out of. Supposedly her ghost doesn’t just haunt the site of the former grocery store, but the buildings on either side of it too. 

Anyway, I was going for a walk one morning, early, as I often do. Heading down the street, I was thinking of the cold, of the weather, of a half-a-dozen other things besides the ghost story about the little girl. I was walking by a series of shops when I heard the noise. 

A terrific sounding crash. 

Jumping, startled, I whirled towards the sound of the noise, only to find myself standing in front of the exact building the girl had fallen into. It’s a jewelry store now, or at least will be until they move out soon, and admittedly it could have been someone working inside who dropped something. Still, the place didn’t open for another two hours, and it was fairly early in the morning. I almost looked in, probably should have looked in, but didn’t, just in case it was one of the workers, and not a ghost. I went on my way, rather shaken up, and have yet to hear anything else, no matter how many times I walk by the building. 

So did I hear the ghostly replaying of that tragic accident, or just the mishandling of a clumsy employee? I don’t know, and will probably never know., but that doesn’t mean I won’t quit hoping to hear it again.",2,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10ru33j/i_heard_the_sound_of_a_crash/,False,2023-02-02 16:32:55,False,False,False,0.79,,,,

emilyrose04011999,None,False,False,False,10rgy6g,False,False,t3_10rgy6g,My haunted experiences,"These won’t be long stories but rather a compilation of stories I have from a house I lived in. I grew up in a small town in Indiana from kindergarten all the way to 5th grade. My grandfather was a landlord and let me, my mom, brother, and later down the road, my soon-to-be-born sister live in this house. I grew up religious, but my mom never forced up to believe what she believed. She wanted us to think for ourselves and learn about other religions and decide what we believe. While I still don’t know whether I believe in ghosts, I do believe in angels and demons. The first story while didn’t happen at my house is a good backstory to how I became fascinated with the Paranormal. I will title the first story The Grim Reaper

**The Grim Reaper**

I was a baby I believe or at least still young enough to sleep in a crib. My grandparents on my dads’ side have always been a big part of my life and I still at the age of 22 try to go up as much as possible. One night I was laid down in my crib. I remember waking up and staring at the posters in my father’s room. My grandparents never took them down and still to this day they are up. These posters are on a large piece of wood that is hung from the ceiling and on the back a large train track my grandfather built. One of the pictures always use to scare me. It was of a circus and the tiger had a snarled nose and large teeth. The storage room is also in this bedroom. It's normally filled with Christmas decorations and board games. My grandma always told us not to go in there cause things could fall and she didn’t want us getting hurt. As I turned over in my crib someone walked out. Not someone I recognize. This man was tall and completely black, wearing what I can only describe as a cloak with a large hood. This thing walked out of the storage room, out my bedroom door, and down the stairs. This object moved slowly and looked almost transparent. I don’t remember being scared or crying. I still sleep in that room today. I remember it as if it was yesterday. Being that young seeing things I couldn’t explain I believe conditioned me to see and experience the things I saw, felt, and heard in my home, such as the lady on the ceiling.

**The Lady on the Ceiling**

My brother and I are 2 years apart in age and have always been 2 peas in a pod. My first experience in this house was not something I saw but rather felt. I wasn’t in kindergarten yet and had a room to myself. Sometimes when I was scared, I would sense a woman in my room. I never saw her but always had a picture of her in my mind. She wasn’t on the ceiling, but I never pictured her standing on the ground. I knew it was a woman's presence. I felt this woman for 6 years until we eventually moved out.

**The Attic door/ Temperature change**

Like I said my brothers’ room was right next to mine connected by a hallway (think of a conjoined hotel room) which was always cold even though we had central heating and cooling. His door was never shut because I found some comfort in being able to see him at night. His room had an attic attached to it. This door was thick and old. The only thing keeping this locked was a barrel bolt lock. The floor was weak, and we could fall through the ceiling if we were to go in there. At least that’s what my mom said. Sometimes when we would wake up the door would be open. My mom thought it was us for a while. We told her it wasn’t, and she made it very clear it was dangerous, and we would get hurt. My brother and I just got used to it and would just close it and lock it if we saw it open. It didn’t stop there. It began to move through the house.

**Bumps in the Night**

This story happened to my mom. We lived in town so hearing people talking outside wasn’t that big of a deal. Everyone knew everyone and sometimes people would sit on our porch to smoke a cigarette. We always heard people talking. The closer you got to the talking the farther away it got. You would look outside, and no one would be there. You could never make out what they were saying. Sometimes it was angry, and sometimes it sounded like a normal conversation. Then the ghost, demon, entity, began ringing our doorbell.

**The Doorbell**

The doorbell always rang. Day and night. At first, we thought it was my friend's ding dong ditching my house but it only did it at certain times. We told my friends to stop, and they were persistent it wasn’t them. We would be casually having a conversation and say a number in the sentence \*You can have 2 pieces of cake\* and the doorbell would ring 2 times. It took us a while to catch on and we started engaging. Telling the spirit to ring it 5 times and it would. We started having some fun. My mom wasn’t a huge fan but my friend and I decided to take some EVP’s.

**EVP’s**

The only prominent EVP I ever caught was on a flip phone. My friend and I went into my bathroom and started asking questions. We told the spirit to touch us. We told them we can stand normal or in a “funky fashion.” In a man’s voice, it said real fast FUNKY FASHION. I don’t remember being touched and neither does she but when we played it back you could hear it. We showed my mom, and you could tell she believed us but blew it off. Later that week I went to my grandma's (the one with the possessed storage room) and little did I know my mom had the house blessed by her friends who hunted ghosts. They said it should help. Boy were they wrong. It helped for a little, but things got more sinister.

**Filament in Bulbs**

The filament in light bulbs is the thing that produces the light. When light bulbs bust or blow it’s the thing you can hear shaking around in the glass. We were having a cookout, and again this is one of my mom’s stories. She went into the bathroom and heard a slight \*tink\* noise. Almost as if you were lightly tapping a spoon on a glass. She flipped the lights on and looked in the mirror. It was them all 5 light bulbs blew. Not just blew. EXPLODED. Like something in a horror movie. It was one at a time. She didn’t notice until she brought her friend in to show him and he said that is almost impossible because all 5 of the filaments were intact. He said they should have separated. Shortly after we started sleeping in my mom's bed.

**Glass Shatter with Bible**

My brother and I liked when my mom read to us and we found comfort in her reading us the bible for some reassurance. One night my mom was reading us verses. My brother and I were scared the spirit what I believe now to be a demon would touch us. She read…

1 John Chapter 5 Verses 18-21

*“We know that everyone who has been born of God does not keep on sinning, but he who was born of God protects him, and the evil one does not touch him.”*

It was then when she told us we would be safe because the devil can scare us, the devil can make bad things happen in our life but he can not touch us as long as we believe in God. It was at that time another \*tink tink tink\* was heard and as soon as we were quiet the glass of water my mom had sitting beside her bed exploded. Yes EXPLODED! She told us that she had dropped it coming up the stairs but years later told us she has no idea why it exploded.

We had the house blessed again by the same people and they told us the small hallway between my brother and I’s room was a portal with high readings. We later moved out of the house and to a town about 30 minutes away. My grandfather re-rented the house out to another family and when visiting his house my brother and I were told not to tell the kids about what we had experienced. We promised, but after only a month that family had packed up and moved to Michigan without notice.

About a year ago I was telling these stories to a girl we adopted during quarantine as she is easily scared and I thought it would be funny. I decided to google search the house to do a “virtual tour” since it is empty again to give her a visual of where things happened……When you google the address nothing pops up. It's as if the house doesn’t exist. When you google earth the address is nothing. I located my grandfather’s address because he lived next door and took the curser down the street. What I saw was so shocking. I won’t tell you what I saw so you are completely unbiased and can draw the conclusion for yourself. Sorry, this was so long, I hope it was worth it.

We would kind of half-joke about it, and even now I kind of look back on it cynically and chalk it up to her wanting attention.

But there was this one time that I still wonder about. 

Charlie had never met her great-grandfather. She had heard a lot of stories about him though. He was a tall, angry man that always wore a three-piece suit and loved to beat his wife and children. He was by all accounts a mean, violent alcoholic. He died destitute and was reported to be buried in a particular cemetery in a nearby city. 

Being a fan of cemeteries, we would visit them frequently. Often to take photographs, or just to explore and “memento mori”. 

One afternoon we were exploring a large cemetery across the street from the cemetery where her great-grandfather was supposed to be. She had often talked about trying to find his grave but no one seemed to know where it was. I believe we had gone looking a few times but came up empty-handed. 

As we were driving slowly through the other cemetery (across the street from where he was reportedly buried) Charlie, who was looking out the passenger window, suddenly yelled out “Stop! Stop the car!” I stomped the brake and she undid her seatbelt, opened the door and walked hurriedly into an area dense with headstones. I watched her walk in about 20 feet and then stop. She was staring at a headstone. I put the car in park and got out and walked over to join her. 

There was his grave. He was buried next to a friend or distant relative, in the other half of a double plot. Apparently when he died, there was no money to bury him, and there was a vacancy thanks to the friend or relative that had a double plot that they ended up with in the divorce. So that meant that there was basically a free hole in the ground they could stick him in, and the guy who was in the other half didn’t mind sharing the eternal resting place since his ex-wife was going to be buried with the postman or whomever. 

She said that she didn’t see the headstone from the car. I believed her about that because she had terrible vision. Uncorrected, her left eye was so bad that she couldn’t recognize my face across a restaurant table if she covered her right eye. She hated wearing glasses so she rarely did if anyone was around. 

She said that she just had a feeling.

G_Katt,None,False,False,True,10ou0l2,False,False,t3_10ou0l2,That wasn’t my sister…,"I’ve experienced many odd and unexplainable events in my life, but this event has been on my mind for a few years now and I finally decided to tell it. And pray I’m not the only one who’s experienced something like this, so let’s start from the beginning. 

I graduated from highschool in 2019 and was promoted to supervisor for a kitchen in a nursing home down the street. Since I oversaw dinner I didn’t start work until about 3:30pm and would get home around 10pm. So for the first half of the day I would be completely home alone, I enjoyed that time. Solitude was always nice, especially when you’re as introverted as I am. 

Normally I would sleep in until about noon, but this time I decided to relax on the couch in our main living room and watch Kitchen nightmares. I remembered nodding off and falling into a light sleep, so any small noise would wake me up. The first few times I cracked my eyes open it would just be from the cats jumping on me, so when I felt the cushion by my feet dip a bit I figured it was my cat Peach. 

After a moment I opened my eyes and realized my younger sister was sitting at the end of the couch, her back to me. I was half asleep so I really didn’t think much of it, I figured she’d just stayed home from school sick. So I just asked her if she could move her head so I could see the tv, but she ignored me. Still facing the TV screen, annoyed I asked her why she was home. Once again she remained silent, coming to the conclusion that she was just being rude. Again I closed my eyes and fell back asleep. 

After about another hour I got up and started to get ready for work and noticed my sister wasn’t in the room or in the house. Concerned I called her, after trying to call her a few times and getting nothing I called my mother. She picked up and I asked her if sis told her where she was going, my mother confused asked me what I was talking about. She dropped sis off at school before going to work, my sister had been at school this whole time. 

In shock I hung up and kept this to myself convinced I was losing my mind. That it was all in my head, but I remember that moment so vividly. What my sister was wearing, how she was sitting, how I felt a shift in the couch when she sat down. 

This wasn’t a dream, this was real it had to be. 

There was something in my house with me that morning and it was not my sister.



I kept this experience to myself, as a kid I had what my parents called a very active imagination. Always seeing things, hearing things and being easily spooked. So I think it got to the point where I just convinced myself this whole experience didn’t happen and that there was some rational explanation, it actually took me a few years to tell my little sister about this. 

Once again mostly out of fear of being perceived as ‘crazy’ and I didn’t want to spook my sister. But something she said to me changed that real fast.

This takes place in September 2022, my sister and I were waiting in line for a ride at a local amusement park. Every year my dad’s workplace would rent the whole park for employees and their families. We spent most of the day together as a family but about an hour before closing sis and I went to the back of the park to ride some night rides so it was just the two of us and the waiting was getting terribly boring. 

Sis and I aren’t very close and don’t have much in common so we struggled to have a conversation and for the most part stood in silence, but out of the blue she spoke up. “Kat, want to hear something freaky?” 

As a lover of all things spooky that caught my attention so I immediately replied with an eager “Yes!”

And a part of me wishes I said no. 

My sister is a night owl, and over the summer would stay up until 6am. I had just started working a different job after quitting my nursing home position. (That’s another scary story for a different day) so I was starting to go to bed at 12am every night and would be up around 10am. So she would be the only one awake, one night she noticed light coming from the crack in her bedroom door and she heard both my voice and our mother’s voices talking. Only it was hard to understand, as if we were either speaking too quickly or just complete gibberish. She quicklky grabbed her phone checking the time and her confusion only grew when she noted it was 3am. 

What were we doing awake? 

Sometimes my mom and I would go to the front window if the weather was bad during the night to keep an eye on the storm, or if there were sirens (we both have a habit of being very nosey) so she figured that’s what was going on. After a few minutes she could still hear the voices and still see the lights, growing curious. She got out of bed and opened her bedroom door and rushed into the hall expecting to see me and my mother by the window talking. 

Only that’s not what she saw. 

There were no lights on, it was completely dark besides the illumination from her phone screen and there was no one in sight. Not our mother, not me. Not even the cats were out there, unsettled and confused. She turned to my bedroom door thinking I was messing with her. She opened my door and I was asleep with both cats. She goes back in the hall, mom and dads bedroom door is also shut. She peeks in there and both are sleeping. 

Now, my sister is a rational person. She was always the one to go in the basement first, tell the others that monsters and ghosts aren’t real. So she completely pushed this event out of her mind, because in her eyes it wasn’t a big deal. 

Maybe she was just overtired, or our grandfather's tv downstairs was a bit loud and that’s what she heard. But like my own experience this kind of sat at the back of her head, and the house grew to be a little less comfortable. 

She mentioned how after that she felt like there was always someone watching, as if they were tucked in a corner just observing her. She wasn’t scared out of her mind just….a bit confused. 


When she told me that a pit in my stomach opened up and I had chills, I laughed at first because c’mon we were in public and I didn’t want to flip out. So we went on the ride and for the remaining time the park was open we pushed that conversation on the back burner. 

On our way to meet up with our parents we started talking about it again, and I finally told her about what happened to me. How I saw her at home that day, spoke to her, and could remember what she wore. That was the first time I saw her get scared, “I wasn’t home,” she kept saying. 

“What do you think it was then?” 

We still don’t know. 

We don’t know if we want to know.

I had just stepped out of my room and opened my eyes because I had been rubbing at them to wake up a little more before I paused.

firerock781,None,False,False,False,10oqix3,False,False,t3_10oqix3,My college apartment,"This story is from about 4 or 5 years ago.

So, this story begins when I was going to college for automotive. I shared an apartment with 3 other guys from my class. It had two floors, the main floor had the living room and the kitchen, and the upper floor had the bedrooms. We all worked jobs and at different hours of the day, so at any given time there was maybe two of use in the apartment at a time. But most of the time I was in the apartment by myself, because of my work schedule.

When I was home alone, I would hear foot steeps upstairs when I would be in the kitchen cooking food or in the living room watching tv or playing games, or when I was upstairs in my room studying, I would hear voices from downstairs. Most of the time I would stop what I was doing to look around to see if one of my roommates where home, but I wouldn't find anyone in the apartment.

When this all started happening, I asked all my roommates if they have heard anything with in the apartment when they were home alone. They all had similar experiences. We all sat and talked about it for a little bit before we all went to bed for the night.

It was about a week or two after we all sat down and talked about it and things started to get more wired. We would be woken in the middle of the night by knocks and other noises. We also started to wake up with random scratches on us and some of my roommates started to get angary for no reason at all.

So, another roommate and decided to sage the apartment. As we were doing it, I was recording on my phone. When we got done, we lifted the apartment for a bit, and I left my phone on a table to rescored while we were gone.  When we got back to the apartment it had a different feeling then it did before we left. A more calming feeling, so we went to bed.

It wasn't till the next morning that I went over the recordings on my phone after I transferred them to my computer. I was shocked on what I founded on the recordings.

As I was listening to them, I founded some EVP's saying things like, look, here, go away, stop, leave, and more. Shortly after that we all moved out of that apartment into a new one.

The_Alligator_Noah,None,False,False,False,10og38g,False,False,t3_10og38g,I wanna know the opinion of ghost experts,"Ok, I'm not an expert. What I am about to tell is 100% real, and if I my suspicions are true, I even have a photo evidence.

This is very fuzzy, because this has been happening to me ever since I have the notion of memory. I have to first tell you that I didn't get baptized until I was 9 yrs old, that is because when my parents tried to do it for the first time, when I was a little child, my grandpa died the exact same day.

Ever since, it is normal for me to get sleep paralysis, and to get nightmares in which demons and evil ghosts want to hurt me. Even my father has many anecdotes of me waking up at night panicked, saying something attacked me, only for when I get in the room again, to go back to sleep pacefully again. The thing is that only my father remembers these times, so I can confidently say that they're sleepwalking episodes. And ever since I was a little kid, I had days, even weeks in which even if I slept enough, I didn't feel as if I rested, I don't have energy those days.

That's all for the sleep part, for the ""I'm awake"" part, I don't feel alone many times when I actually am. Even my puppy cries a lot, and my cat chases a lot of ""invisible things"". Heck, when I was a kid I believed the tooth fairy was real because one day, when one of my baby teeth fell off, I saw my cat chasing something I couldn't see. Something new that happens to me ever since last year is that I get scratches and I don't even know how, and it happens when I'm awake. It's strange, it's being okay and then, suddenly, feeling a sharp pain and seeing the scratch on my hands (I have one right know, I can make photos if necesary).

For last, I have an impossible shadow on a photo I made this summer, I didn't notice it until now. Is all of this just paranoia?

wernerverklempt,None,False,False,True,10o5nx1,False,False,t3_10o5nx1,Dark silhouette in the woods,"This is a rewrite/repost of a story I previously had posted here and later deleted. For some reason I periodically go through and remove all of my stories. Then later I might rewrite them. 

This happened one evening in the summer of 1984 or thereabouts. 

I was a teenager walking around with three friends in the general area of the suburban neighborhood where we all lived. There wasn’t a lot to do, so it was common for kids our age to stroll around at night, talking, laughing and getting into minor mischief. 

There was a large wild area with streams, a swampy area, lots of trees and a rocky area with mounds of dirt. It was an area of several acres, mostly surrounded by single-family homes in a few adjacent neighborhoods. There were houses on three sides, and on the forth, a large empty field, an elementary school and some municipal buildings. 

There was a narrow asphalt path that ran through the middle of the area, presumably to provide a way for kids to walk to and from the school. The whole area was referred to as “The Path”. It had a reputation amongst the kids as a scary and dangerous place. In my mind as a child, the Manson family (or the Shrewsbury equivalent) was living there, holding satanic rituals and sacrificing kids like me. In reality, the scariest thing was older kids smoking pot and drinking pilfered bottles of Michelob in the woods or making out in shady leafy hollows. 

So on this particular evening, it was Frank, Keith, Brian and me wandering around aimlessly. We decided to walk down a dead-end street and cut through the yards into the woods of The Path. It was dusk, the light fading completely as we cut through, stepping over an old stone wall and into the dense underbrush. 

We didn’t have a flashlight, and the only way we could see where we were going was to spark the flint wheel on an empty Bic lighter one of us had. It provided a quick dim strobe flash by which we could get our bearings.

We picked our way single file through the underbrush to a narrow flowing brook. There was a fallen log across the stream, so it was a quick one-two step to cross it. On the other side, as we knew from playing in the woods, was a narrow dirt path that ran perpendicular to and intersected with the asphalt-paved main path off to our left, maybe one hundred yards away. To the right, the path continued through the dense brush and made a ninety degree turn and traversed a slight rise through a forested area, ending in the large field by the school. 

One by one we quick-stepped across the log over the stream and pushed through the bushes onto the overgrown dark narrow path. I was third in line, Frank and Keith having gone first. As I emerged from the brush, and as Brian was making his way across, I heard Keith’s voice, shrill and frightened, “There’s someone standing right there!”

Frank and Keith were to my left, facing in my direction. I whipped my head to the right, and sure enough, there was a man standing there not six feet from me. It wasn’t a tree.

It was just a dark silent shape. Appeared solid. A man-shaped blotch darker than the darkness. No question. A man, standing there. I could make out the round brim of a hat that appeared to be tilted back on his head, so the outline was ovalish, not a horizontalish line of a hat pulled low across the forehead. The figure was silent. Unmoving.

As I stared in terror, the figure shifted slightly, maybe turning or raising an arm. Somehow my impression of this was not movement, but a subtle change in the shape of the silhouette. It was unclear what the movement was, but it was just that it was a slightly different outline, but it displayed no perceptible motion. 

We broke and ran away in a panic, truly scared for sure, but laughing and hooting hysterically, leaving poor Brian behind to be murdered. We reached the asphalt path and stopped, catching our breath, with Brian arriving a few seconds behind us. He hadn’t seen a thing and was somewhat perplexed, to say the least. 

As we stood panting and jabbering under a streetlight at the south end of the path, we compared what we had seen. Frank and Keith concurred with what I had seen: A slim, silent man in a hat. 

Then Keith said, “When I was looking at it, it sort of…changed. Like it didn’t move, but it changed shape.” That gave me goosebumps, since that was the same subjective observation that I had had.

Brian didn’t see a thing. Poor Brian.

The dirt path was very overgrown, with weeds and bushes all but obscuring it. It was disused by that point, so it wasn’t easy going and wasn’t a route one would take as a reasonable choice, especially at night. 

That is what made it particularly frightening. To encounter someone standing silent and motionless, exactly where we happened to emerge onto the path after crossing the brook. Who was it and why were they just standing there? How did they get there and why didn’t they speak to us? Why were they wearing what appeared to be a farmer’s hat?

All of these things flashed quickly through my mind when I saw the figure, but in one sudden jolt, arriving all at once as a giant “WTF!?” in a primal part of my brain. 

My impression was that of a slim man in his 30s or 40s, about 5’8-10”. Kind of the same build as my doctor as a kid, who always reminded me of a guy from the Civil War era because he was short, thin and serious. Was it one of the residents of the neighborhood who, perturbed by the obnoxious teenagers cutting through his yard, had somehow silently and quickly threaded his way through the dense, dark underbrush in order to menacingly glower at us in silence? It could have been, and if so, that in itself is terrifying. Bravo on scarring us for life, Doctor B.

I am still in touch with Frank, and we talk about that experience from time to time. Nearly forty years later it still gives me chills to recall the encounter.

msbrilliant,None,False,False,False,10nsgj2,False,False,t3_10nsgj2,True story,"I worked at a psych facility for teens. My first week we had a breaker throw, and it was going to take Maintenance 3hrs to get to us. I volunteered to go to the basement and flip through breaker back. None of the other staff would go to the basement, (should have been my first clue). I get down there, and looking over all the breakers, and this man's voice sounds behind me ""What are you doing?"" Thinking it's Maintenance and I just didn't hear him come down the stairs, that creak loudly, I turn around to met with no one. I can't find the flipped breaker, and go back upstairs and asked if anyone else went down. Nothing, no one, every one was accounted for.  This was the first time I encountered something there. 

Next was the overpowering smell of Gardenias or Gardenia perfume. I would get sick or dizzy then smell it. Some of the kids had similar experiences, as well as the staff. 

The overnight staff was supposed to be one at one end of the house, and another at the other end. I was in the living room sitting where I could see the basement door, and saw hands, like at least 3-4 pairs of hands reaching and clawing out from the bottom of that door. 

Another night I was sitting at the other end of the house and her something upstairs, I go to the bottom of the stairs and see red glowing eyes. I glared at it, and hissed. ""Leave them alone!"" It growled at me and the eyes lifted to a standing position, then disappeared. 

I had a kid, he was 17 a week away from discharging and had a college scholarship, (not likely to make up stories), we were playing hide and seek. The kids would hide while one-two staff watched to make sure they all hid separately, and one staff was the seeker. I was the seeker, and went to find one of the kiddos. I saw some in one of the bedrooms go from standing to hiding in the closet. There was a blanket that looked like a person under it. I pulled it up, and nothing was under it, but something black streaked across my vision, into another bedroom. The kiddo who was hiding in the other closet comes out, and then stares at me wide eyed. ""I heard someone say 'Got you.' Then touch my shoulder, it wasn't you, was it?"" I didn't allow the kids to hide upstairs anymore. 

Another overnight shift, I'm the living room again, and I see this black shadow of a man, at least six foot, turn the ""blind"" corner (we had one of those mirrors to see, saw him on the mirror) then I see him in the widow in the kitchen, and then finally walk out through the side door. 

We had ""electrical"" issues with doors unmagging (all doors had to be locked where the kids couldn't leave without staff knowing/allowing, and crazy family members couldn't enter willy knilly, yes they tried. They ""fixed"" it, but it would happen at least once a month to more. 

Several times when I would get off at 11pm or midnight I would see someone in my backseat, as I was leaving. I would calmly say ""you aren't welcome here."" Or ""you cannot come with me."" The entity would disappear. One time I felt something latch onto my back, creepiest feeling. It took about 15 minutes to get it off, with prayer, before I left the drive. 

During my time working there, I had several miscarriages (normal for me, had a medical problem which is no resolved), many nightmares, developed major anxiety, became paranoid, and my insomnia worsened. After I finally quit, I lost a whole bunch of weight, that I had packed on (almost weighed 200lbs at 5ft 3, normally weighed closer to 130), and got pregnant successfully almost a year later. Crazy enough, I didn't quit because of the demons/ghosts, I quit because a passed kid killed himself. I couldn't handle knowing that no matter how much we helped, sometimes it didn't help. I went to work at an assisted living instead, where if the patients died, they had had a long life, usually a long happy, fulfilled life.",13,111.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10nsgj2/true_story/,False,2023-01-28 23:11:45,False,False,False,0.98,,,,

One night I awoke sometime in the wee hours in the dark bedroom. I saw movement to my right and turned my head and saw the dark silhouette of an arm sticking straight up from the bed. The hand was bent at the wrist, dangling, with fingers fanned out and limp. The arm and hand was slowly waving back and forth. 

I assumed it was my wife, perhaps dreaming. I watched, somewhat disturbed at the strange behavior and motion. 

I reached my hand out to gently grab her arm to wake her up, and to my surprise there was only air. The silhouette faded away. 

Startled and frightened , I called out her name. She sleepily answered me. I felt the covers and her arms were both completely underneath. 

It took me quite a while to get back to sleep. 

Another time my wife woke up and looked over to see the silhouette of “me” sitting up in bed next to her. She asked me what I was doing, waking me up to groggily respond to her. 

When she heard my voice come from the bed instead of head-level of the sitting figure, she was similarly startled and frightened.

However, this night i was sound asleep, not even dreaming i was so deep in my sleep, and i felt something freezing cold touch my foot and it startled me awake, like tunnel vision and hyper awareness immediately… it felt like a hand that had been bare out in the cold.. so cold it almost felt wet.. immediately the thought of an elderly white woman with frazzled medium length hair and small bony hands popped into my head.. it took me a second to pull myself all the way together, but i was definitely startled awake.. 
logically i want to say it was just my dogs wet nose.. but my feet were under the covers and i remember my dog being asleep.. i have no idea what it was.. i suppose i don’t know if it was real… but it’s still one of the freakier very possibly paranormal experiences I’ve had in my life.

Although, i figure since i’m here i might as well share the only other potentially paranormal encounter seared into my brain.. growing up i used to hear the shower doors in my bathroom rattle at night… never during the day, only at night… our house was built in the late 1800s or maybe early 1900s (like, 1895-1910).. i had these beautiful sliding glass doors as cover for my step in bathtub shower, clearly a remodel done in the 60s.. but at night they would shake.. and when i asked my dad he said 3 things on 3 separate occasions: “it’s probably just the house settling”; “it’s probably just the trains” (the trains were about a mile away and I’m unsure how frequently they ran..); and when i asked him again as an adult he said “I’m not sure what that could have been” and in response to me bringing up his prior answers he said “no.. neither of those make sense.. ha that’s ridiculous.

dwp4you,None,False,False,True,10ng8dw,False,False,t3_10ng8dw,telling my ghost story,"I rented a haunted house in El Paso, TX (Very LONG POST but worth the read!!!)


Anyway, back in 2011 I was living in a house in El Paso, TX for a year with my two sons. It was a nice place with a huge back yard for our dogs and 3BRs, 2 dens and a two-car garage. Great place for the price I was renting it. Also, the landlord lived almost across the street from me, so he was always close-by if needed.

Shortly after moving in (a matter of weeks) I was in my bedroom watching TV and unwinding from a long day. I was unemployed at the time and had received a severance check from my ex-employer and was living off of that while I was job-searching. My BR was right across the hall from my youngest son's BR, and my older son had his BR nextdoor to mine as he was disabled and there were times I would have to get up in the middle of the night if he needed to use the bathroom.

Late that night, I heard singing coming thru the AC vents and assumed it was my son's girlfriend (whom had just moved in with us and had a great singing voice). I chalked it up to that and told myself that I would speak to my son about it in the morning.

The following morning, I asked my son about it with his GF there, and he told me that he thought the singing was coming from my room. They thought maybe I was watching something on TV and just turned up theirs to block out the song. Weird!

This house was an older house (built in 1959) and built in an 'L' shape with one side of the 'L' having bedrooms and bathrooms and the other side had the den, dining room, kitchen, another room that could be used as and office or spare bedroom and ended with the garage. All doors and windows had wrought iron. It started that when we would leave the house, we would lock the wrought iron door going into the house from the garage, and many times upon our return, the door would be unlocked. The same happened when we were IN the house. That door would remain unlocked while we were all inside the house - but many times when I would have to go to the garage, the door would be locked.

Also, this house had been renovated. It had new tile, carpet, cabinets in the kitchen and such. But certain rooms had these 'old-style' pushbutton light switches. They would be 'lit' if the lights in the room were off, and then you would push it and the switch would make a loud audible 'double-click' (sounded kinda like ka-chuk!) and the lights would turn on. In the hallway, the guest bathroom's light started turning ON at different times of the night - but only when we were awake. We could be watching TV in the den, and you would hear the ""click"" and the light in the bathroom would be on. No one was around when it did this, and we could find no reason for it to be doing this. I remember shortly after we had moved in, I had a brother over to help me connect all of my devices to connect a new wifi-modem. After he got done getting everything set up, it was dark outside and he asked where the bathroom was, I told him ""1st door on the left down the hallway"". I heard him go in, press the lightswitch (ka-chuk) and as I heard him relieving himself (the house was not THAT big of a house) I heard the loud ""ka-chuk"" again and then my brother screamed out ""What the f*@k?"". He flushed and came out, we told him we had all heard it and told him that this was happening on a kind of regular basis.

As we were still settling in at this house, I bought a ""touch-sensitive"" lamp that I could place on the table next to my sons hospital bed, so that those times that he called me late at night I could just go in and tap the light and have light in his room. From OFF, if you touched the light once it would light dimly (or low), the second touch would be brighter (medium), a third touch would put the light at it's brightest setting. And of course, the fourth touch would turn it off again. Well, after about a week that this light was there, it started to turn on in the middle of the night. BUT, it always seemed to turn on between 12AM and 2AM. AND it was always on at the second (medium) setting. Never the low or the high setting. There was no way that my disabled son would have been able to reach that light as it was to the left of his bed and out of range of his hands and arms (he has had limited range of motion in his arms after his car accident). This light turned on EVERY NIGHT without fail. There were several times that I would try to stay awake just so that I could catch the light turning on and run into the room to catch our invisible culprit. It never worked. I could be sitting up in bed, with my door open watching for the hallway to brighten from the light being turned on. I was never able to catch it! As soon as I would start to doze off and my eyes would close, I would snap awake and the light would already be on. 

At this time, I downloaded a Ghost Hunters app on my iphone to test some things out. That night I was walking around the house trying to get EMF readings. They were highest in my son's room. My brother was over again that night and told me it was probably picking up the electrical current from the wiring in the walls. So, we decided to kill all power to the house at the main fusebox and to check the room again. Even with the power turned off the EMF readings were high in the guest bedroom and highest again in my disabled son's room.

One night, I had my girlfriend staying over and that night after we had had our fun, we opened the door to my room so if my son called I could hear him. We went to sleep. I woke up to her screaming yelling that someone was at the door. I looked and sure enough there was a shadow figure at the door (I'm getting goosebumps typing this). I jumped out of the bed as I saw it move to the left of the door and ran into the hallway. From there I saw the shape go into the bathroom (the same one that had the light being turned on my itself). I turned on the light, my hands shaking AND THE ROOM WAS EMPTY. I could not get my GF to go back to sleep and she packed up her stuff and left. 

The next day, I decided to go across the street to speak with my landlord and tell him the things that were happening. It was then that he told me that he had bought the house after the woman that had lived there had passed on (she died in the house) and he bought it and turned it into a rental property and I was his first tenant at that house. After I told him all of the things that we happening, he told me that he was willing to rent a video camera that we could set up in my son's room. I told him, maybe. That we would just see how things progressed as no one had been harmed and whatever was in that house did not seem malevolent in any way.

As weeks turned into months and each night passing meant me waking up in the middle of the night to turn off the light in my son's room as it would wake me up eventually. The doors around the house would lock/unlock themselves, the light in the bathroom would turn on/off, etc. We kind of got used to it.

One night I was asleep in my room. I had the AC on, and the ceiling fan on in my room as El Paso summer nights can be hot as hell. Anyway I was asleep and was awakened by the sound of the vertical blinds knocking against themselves. I wrote it off the the air being moved by the fan and the AC. I closed my eyes and was just about to doze off again, when I felt the hair on the back of my neck prick up. I closed my eyes tighter and told myself ""Don't look!"". As soon as I thought that, I felt breathing on my right ear and as plain as day something whispered ""MOTHER"" into my ear. I yelled and jumped out of bed and turned on my lights... and NOTHING. There was no one there.

As time moved on, I started dating another woman with three kids and when things started to get serious between her and I, I converted the room that could be used as an office to a spare bedroom with a set of bunk beds and another small bed for this GF's youngest daughter. As they would come over and started spending weekends with us, they started experiencing things too! Mostly the shadow figure. The little girl was the one that would see this the most, get scared and come into our room and jump into bed with us. 

All of us had experiences with ""the shadow"" as we started to call it. There were times I would be watching TV in the den, and I would feel the hair on the back of my neck stand up. I would spin around only to catch a dark steak moving away and in a second it was gone.

Anyway, as our 1-year lease was coming close to an end, I contacted the El Paso Paranormal Society and asked if they could come out and check out the house. I called them, sent an email via their website and never got an answer. My GF and I got married (this did not last, but that's another story) and we ended up buying a house in the same neighborhood only about three blocks from this one. As we were almost done with our move, I was finally contacted by the El Paso Paranormal Society. Needless to say, they were anxious to come check out the house and wanted to set up an appointment about 2 weeks from the day of their call. I told them we were already moving to a new place and that we would not be living there any longer by the time they would be able to come out. So, the guy I spoke to time me ""Make sure that the last thing that I should do when I leave this house for the final time would be to 'announce' to whatever was in that house, that it needed to stay there and that it was not allowed to follow me. His telling me this gave me chills. But, I said sure! Ok.

That night, as me and my GF were getting the last things out of that house, we did a final walk-through, making sure all the lights were off, the doors locked, etc. The landlord had already been over to inspect and just asked us to leave a light on in the house. We chose to leave the light on in the kitchen as it had a window with vertical blinds that looked out onto the driveway of the house. This way it would seem as if someone was home. As my wife and I got into each of our own cars and had our windows down and were speaking to each other, I remembered what the ghost hunter guy had told me. I yelled over to my wife to ""hold on a sec"". I got out of my car, unlocked and opened the front door and stood in the doorway and said ""Whatever is in this house THIS IS NOW YOUR HOUSE. You are not allowed to follow us. YOU MUST STAY HERE!"". I backed out of the house, closed and locked the door and got back into my car. I yelled over to my wife ""Let's go?"", when all of the sudden RIGHT IN FRONT OF BOTH OF US - we saw one of the vertical blinds in the kitchen window move sideways as if someone was looking out. (Getting chills again). We looked at each other and said ""Let's get the f*@k out of here!"", and we left!

I almost left out one of the creepiest things...

There was one morning that I awoke very early. Like 4:30ish, and that damn light was on in my son's room. AGAIN! I always tried to catch the light and turn it off before it woke my son as due to his brain injury - sleep was very important for him to have. As I walked in quietly to turn off the light, I was pissed that this had been going on so long and nightly. I tapped the light twice to turn it off and started to walk out of the room. I stopped at the foot of my son's hospital bed and said out loud ""If there is something here, turn on that fucking light!"", and almost immediately - THE LIGHT TURNED ON! . I did not realize that my son (who I thought was asleep at the time) woke up. The look of terror on his face shook me to my core. To this day, I still have nightmares about that morning, and the look on his face.

After that morning, I unplugged that lamp and put it away in the garage. Still, like I said there were other things that occurred here, but this post would be easily 10x what I posted to even begin to touch on most of it.

The house is real. It is located at 2921 Fir Street in EP TX. You can Google it and see it looks like a normal house. You can even see the kitchen window that is close to the driveway that had that single verticle blind pushed sideways that last night there. 

Update!!! 

Now for the kicker! Since I made the original post, I have been contacted by two persons that knew this house and knew the couple that lived there. As mentioned earlier, the woman that lived there previous died in that house. What I did not know was that she died and stayed in that house undiscovered for a little more than a week. Eventually the police were called by one of the persons that had contacted me about my original post to do a wellness check due to mail and newspapers starting to pile up, and no one answering the door when they would knock. After the police gained access to the house, she was found dead in hallway BTWN my son's room and the bathroom with the light that would turn on/off at all times of the night. 

Also, I was told this lady that lived in that house became very angry and hateful as she grew older. She was paranoid and developed dementia. She became so hateful and cruel that she alienated all of her family, even her husband who eventually moved out and paid the bills while she lived there alone. When he passed (the husband), this lady kept the urn with his ashes on the kitchen table that looked out onto the front driveway. The same window that had the vertical blind pushed sideways as if something/someone was looking out at me and my wife at the time on our last night at that house when we moved out.

I was told that the room that my son slept in, that as the lady suffered more and more from dementia - she made of shrine of sorts... with paper after paper taped to the wall asking God to save her, to not hate her, to forgive her, for her family to love her. This same wall when my son was set up in that room had his medals from track and cross country. Pictures of his friends, newspaper articles. I was even told by this same person that when she was younger, one of this lady's daughters told her (this neighbor witness) whe this daughter was a child, that she did not like to be in that room because a dark smoke came out of the outlet at night. The same outlet that my son had his touch-lamp plugged into.

This means that there was also something in that house even while the couple that lived there were both alive. As told to me by this same 'witness', this house was the first house built in this subdivision back in 1959. I wonder now, what was it built over... 

Believe me when I say that there was much more that happened in this house that I did not cover. So much in fact, that I had always thought about writing about it as a book. My own tests and traps that I set up to try to document proof were kind of crazy too. I went so far a dusting the metal dome of the touch lamp with flour just to see if there would ever be prints. Running thread the same color of the carpet an inch from the floor across my son's doorway, so that it was almost unseen... hoping to see the string snapped from whatever was entering my son's room at night. Never got a damn thing!

It has been years since I have lived there, and this house is very close to my son's mother's house. The times that I have to go over there (to my exes house l) I make it a point to drive by this place. There are new tenants there, well - not new as they have lived there since shortly after I moved out. 

I always wonder if they too are having experiences there. 

Ghosts are real! Hauntings are real. I think and believe that because both my son and I both had very close calls with almost dying (another story for another time), that this made us more susceptible and open to the entities in that house.

Anyway, the story is all true. The house is real. I do not know if the new tenants have had any experiences, and I see no reason to go back to that house and find out.

One morning I was casually lying in my bed, watching tv and as a kids usually do, I did not want to get up yet. At some point I realized someone was intently looking at me, from the corner of the window. It was an old lady shrouded in black clothes. I was frightened and couldn’t tear my eyes away from her. At some point, she retreated and when I got up to see the yard, I could see her making her way for  the kitchen. No tenants let alone an elderly lady lived in the house at the time.

None,None,False,False,False,10mymly,False,False,t3_10mymly,I have a feeling my house is haunted.,"It’s going to be a long story so get ready. 

I came to this house during the beginning of 2016. At first everything was fine and then months laters I felt like this house was weird. I was young so I couldn’t explain it but I was joking with my mom saying that my house was haunted. 

I always felt I was being watched by someone in my living room, my garage and my bed room. I does not feel safe anywhere except my mother’s bed room. 

My first paranormal thing that happened is one day years ago (before covid, I think it was 2019 or 2018), it was late at night because I always go sleep late and I always take a shower before going to bed, and when I left the bathroom and I was going to climb the stairs (I also want to specify that the stairs have ""holes"" ie I can see below (I don't know what it's called) so I can see part of the stairs from below and a bit of my ground floor) and when I was about to take my first step to go upstairs I saw a man with a bit coat, a hat and a suitcase almost like if someone was going home after a long day of work. It was so realistic and the man was so chill that it was really scary. He walked the stairs below me and he was going to arrive to where was so I was so scared that I run to my bedroom. I never saw his face and never saw him again. Now I regret it because I would have wait to see his faces or anything else. But he was just so chill and it was almost like it was his house and he came back from work after a long day.

Almost feel like he didn't notice me and it was him coming back to his house after work. I heard people saying that if you see that men, it means someone is gonna die soon and my grand pa died months after this.

I also have a hatch that is sealed on the floor above on the ground floor next to the bedrooms and in front of my attic, my mother has never had any info on that and why it is sealed. I will try to post a photo.

I had also recently my door of my garage unlocked and opened when she is always locked. My mom thinks she forgot to lock it but trust me, she never does. 

During this summer, a lot of stings were found death in front of the bed of my mother in her bedroom. It was not just one, it happened a lot of times but then it stopped. She was never stung by one of them, she just woke up and every day for a couple of days she found death stings. Doors, windows were locked and no holes in the wall. 

The people leaving in this house before were an old couple but none of them died there.

I also remember to have a cold wind in my shower on my body with a shiver when my door and window were locked and it happened a couple times and then one recently. 

I also had a dream with my teddy bear and I think he is haunted. So in my dream, I was in an old house (it was my house that I shared with my mom and my sister) and we decided to pack stuff to throw away. We went to the attic with my mom and they were toys (old dolls (porcelain, mid 1900's) and teddy bears) and I said to my mom « We'll sort them out and throw them away » and I was looking to the left and I saw a teddy bear and his head is turning towards me, I was scared and then all the toys jumped on me and my mother and I wake up terrified.

That's not the only thing I wanna share. have the same teddy bear that I had in my dream in real life. I saw it months ago in a store and I really liked him so I decided to buy it online from the same company. But even if I find him really cute, I always had bad vibes since I had him.
Firstly, when I was on my computer and he was on my bed I always felt like something was watching me (I never had that feeling before even with my other dolls (because I have also dolls)) and I couldn't sleep with him in my bed so I was so scared that days later receiving him, I put him in my attic. So it is related that I got attacked in an attic by the same teddy bear in my dream ? The same teddy bear is currently in my actual attic so it’s almost like it’s a meaning. 

Also wanna mention that the house in my dream have two identical rooms of my real house. The ground floor and living room.

If someone can help me with this and have any advices or anything else, I will love to hear from you.",13,19.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10mymly/i_have_a_feeling_my_house_is_haunted/,False,2023-01-27 22:50:19,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

It was the 45th day of my mom's passing away and in our culture it is believed that the soul stays in the house till that time and then they leave the house. So I was sleeping in the living room for the entire time after my mom's passing. I felt a hand go from my head slowly thru my body till my toes, slowly dragging her fingers across. As soon as it reached my toes, I woke up and I know it wasn't a dream and you know the state where you are kind of awake and you can feel the surroundings, yes I was in that state. 

So I feel to this day my mom was there to say her last goodbye to me. She loved me dearly and worried about me too much. I miss her oh so much till this day. She passed away in  Sept 2009 with a brain hemorrhage.

anon198509,None,False,False,False,10m7oxk,False,False,t3_10m7oxk,Haunting in Georgia,"One of my good friends in high school had this lake house, it was given to his parents by their grandparents and they lived in this house from 90-93. One day in 93 his mom woke him and his younger sister up and left the house, mind you it was 2-3AM. They went to a restaurant that was open 24/7 and stayed there until sunrise and went home, packed all of their clothing and and other important things and left the house. They never went back and his mother will not talk about what happened. They still own this property, it has 2 homes on it and is lakefront, probably worth millions. The power is still on and his dad comes and checks on it every so often.

So in hearing that story, we of course went to the lake house. Pulling up a motion sensor flood light flicked on and stayed on. Unlocked the deadbolt, which requires a key to open on both sides,and walked in, instantly you got that creepy feeling like someone was watching you. We walked around for about half an hour, walking up the stairs and unlocking another door with a deadbolt on both sides, and man was it eerie, all the furniture still set up, his sisters nursery still intact, and a tea kettle still on the stove. Just straight up creepy in every way.

Finally we go to leave and decide to go through the garage, I have the keys and, again, you had to have a key to unlock it from the inside. I’m trying to open the door and turn around to get a light, just in time to see a rock come from somewhere down the hall and hit my foot. Staring at all 3 of my friends and not seeing them do anything with their arms or leg or anything else, I decide to try to unlock the door more rapidly. Finally find the right key and put it in the key hole, as soon as I do the garage door opens about 2 feet and thanks to the motion sensor floodlight that’s still on I can see a chair in the garage. The chair proceeds to be thrown against the wall with a violence I can’t describe and the garage door is slammed shut. I turn around to say let’s get the hell out of here and see a rock come from darkness and hit the wall with a lot of force right next to my head. At this point I’m done.

We run back to the stairs down to the basement and for the safety of the door we came in, the door which requires a key on either side to lock or unlock and we left unlocked, is locked. Freaking out hearing what sounds like heavy running footsteps upstairs I am panicking to find the key, finally I find it and unlock the door. We run to the next door and you guessed it, locked. I again find the right key as the footsteps are getting louder and coming down the stairs. We run out the door and it gets left open by the last person out and then as we go to shut it the door is slammed shut and instantly you hear the deadbolt get locked.

At this point we are only focusing on getting out of this place, we run to the truck and all 4 of us pile in and as soon as the truck starts every single light in the house comes on, at once. My buddy slams it into reverse and we are flying down this very long driveway and as soon as our tires leave the gravel and hit the pavement, every light in the house turns off, leaving it in absolute darkness.

Something very very bad is in that house, not sure what but I’ll never go back and I absolutely believe in ghosts, demons, etc. Believe it or not this is the short version of this story and the backstory of the house is even creepier.",25,103.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10m7oxk/haunting_in_georgia/,False,2023-01-27 00:50:13,False,False,False,0.99,,,,

Gloomy_Cicada,None,False,False,False,10m26hi,False,False,t3_10m26hi,Expanding on the evil entity in my dreams,"Someone asked what the conversations were like, so I’ll elaborate a little. 

I can’t remember everything perfectly, but in the beginning it told me I could do anything and that I had big potential. I would always smile and thank him in the dreams. It made me feel really good at the time, but looking back I’m sure it was trying to play on my ego to get me to do the things it wanted me to do later on. 

Once it got malicious, it said a few specific things I can remember vividly because they were very upsetting to me. One time it was my mom standing over me burning me with a cigarette all over my body (she was a heavy smoker.) “She” was basically just telling me I was worthless and that she hated me and to commit suicide. I knew it was a part of this things agenda because of that dread feeling I always got. It was a fucking horrible feeling every time I would dream about that thing, I can’t stress it enough. 

Another time it pretended to be a guy I was in love with at the time. I’ll call him Josh. Two joshes walked into my apartment, and then one of them went back downstairs. I asked the remaining one if he was the real josh, to which he replied no. I asked him where the real josh was going, and with a disgusting smile, he said “everywhere.” And with that, I heard a gunshot and saw a bullet hole appear in the floor at my feet. Blood splattered around the hole and the josh in front of me laughed this hideous evil laugh that I’ll never forget. Again, that feeling was there. I woke up crying. That one stuck with me for a while. 

Another time, I began dreaming that my current boyfriend was propped up over top of me in bed and we were kissing. After a while he said “I’m so glad that you’re you, and I’m me,” but he said it in a creepy tone of voice that insinuated that it was not my boyfriend who was on top of me. It started laughing, and I then felt my actual boyfriend turning over in the bed next to me sleeping. That one was terrifying.

Gloomy_Cicada,None,False,False,True,10lnovd,False,False,t3_10lnovd,I was visited by something evil in my dreams,"I grew up Catholic and began questioning my faith around the age of 14. It was a dark time for me and I believe that because I was vulnerable, something took the opportunity to harass me, for lack of a better word. 

When I was about 14, I started having dreams that felt different from the others. In the beginning, there was always a man. He was very handsome, tall with black hair and ice blue eyes. He was very comforting to me and would give me advice about specific things in my life. I looked forward to dreaming about this man. 

Then, as I continued having these dreams, he starting acting a bit different. He would say things that made me question his motives. Things that just didn’t seem right, like a “friend” pretending to compliment you, but really making fun of you. I started getting uncomfortable with it. 

Eventually, he started telling me all these things to do that would “help” me. Things like killing people who have hurt me, or killing myself so that I can be happy. He became angry with me when I disagreed.

When I would dream about him, I would always feel the same sense of deep dread and horror. It was intense fear that I would feel as soon as a dream began, and I knew he was there. In one particular dream, he chased me through the streets of what looked like a dark, gloomy city from the early 1900s. He was trying to kill me. I started saying the Lord’s Prayer and woke up immediately. This is when it got really bad. 

I never saw him as the handsome man after that point. He took the form of people I loved and said horrible things to me. I was told how worthless I was and to kill myself. Most commonly, he was my mother saying these things (my mother was abusive and we had a very bad relationship.) 

Each time this would happen, I would pray and usually I would wake up. After some time, that became less effective. Every time I would pray I felt like I was being choked or that I couldn’t breathe or move my mouth. Nonetheless, I would continue waking up. 

All of this happened over probably a hundred dreams from the age of 14 to 19 when I moved into my own apartment. I had one last dream there, and since then it has stopped. I am 21 now. I think that because I continued praying and staying confident in defending myself, it because less fun for whatever that thing was, and it left me. 

I hope I never feel that feeling at the beginning of a dream again.

Rycelondon,None,False,False,True,10joke6,False,False,t3_10joke6,"Haunting in Hampshire, UK","Before I moved to London, I used to live in a 1950’s built house in Hampshire, UK. My parents had purchased it ‘99 from an old couple who had lived in it since it was built (so no one had died in it).  

The first strange thing that happened was the cats wouldn’t stay in the house. They would always bolt out for some reason. After my parents started renovating, my brother and I both started to feel like we were being watched in the house, and at night in the living room, you would always feel like something was watching you through the new glass doors from the hallway or the stairs. After a while, if we were sitting downstairs, we started to hear footsteps moving from my bedroom in the room above, walking to my brother’s neighbouring room, then across the landing to the hallway to my parent’s room. 

My parents both dismissed it as the pipes cooling or the floorboards settling, but you could distinctly tell exactly what boards the footsteps where treading on. At one point friends came over, I was alone, and as you walked down the street you could see into our living room - they asked if I had relatives staying as they had seen people sitting on the sofa. Things started to move - you’d place shoes by the door, and then they’d be under the stairs, or things like keys would be moved somewhere else.

Then it gets really creepy. One day I had run a bath, and was listening to music on the computer in the study in the next room. It had been a while and the music had stopped as the PC has gone into standby mode. I had been in the bath about an hour and fell asleep, and as the water had just gone past my nose, the music on the PC shot back on louder and woke me up (bearing in mind, in those days you had to mash the keyboard or really jiggle the mouse to wake up the computer), saving me from potentially drowning. I took this to be whatever was in the house wasn’t bad… however a few weeks later I woke up bolt upright like something had woken me up, must have been around 2am. My door was open on to the landing and it was a bright full-moon night, shining through the hallway onto the brick landing. I looked, and to my terror I saw an old man, but he wasnt standing up, it was like he was laying down on the stairs and his head was at foot height, staring around the landing wall, directly at me. 

The moonlight was on his face, it haunts me to this day. 

I closed the door and slept with my light on for the rest of the night. 

My parents sold the house in 2004 when they moved to New Zealand - and when I spoke to my dad about it later, he said he knew something was in the house but hadn’t wanted to scare my brother and I. 

He’d had his own experiences. 

He’d heard the same footsteps on the floorboards and in the mornings when he’d get up and make tea for mum, he’d hear footsteps behind him in the kitchen walking towards him,something brushing past him and the taps would turn on by themselves… 

Years later, when I told him about the old man I’d seen, he said on a few occasions he’d been in the lounge at night, and in the reflection of his reading glasses, he could see the exact same man sitting in the armchair behind him…

My dad is a massive skeptic, a policeman back in the day and a no nonsense project director - apparently he was so freaked out, he went to the public records office to see what our house had been built on. The area had been made up of old mansion estates back in the Victorian times, and it looked like our kitchen had been built over a pathway leading from the old big house to an icehouse outbuilding. He thinks maybe it was the servants or whoever walked that path… very spooky.",20,117.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10joke6/haunting_in_hampshire_uk/,False,2023-01-23 21:49:21,False,False,False,0.99,,,,
firerock781,None,False,False,False,10jv503,False,False,t3_10jv503,Backroad ghost car,"So, this story is from 2 or 3 years ago. One night on my way home from work and to get to home I take some backroads as shortcuts. But on this particular night it was snowing and the roads where a little icy, so I was driving slower than I normally do. On this rout I normally take day in, and day out has a long stretch of road that has hills and can be ruff sometimes and has no house or hunting camps on it or any other turn offs. It's about 3 or 4 miles till the next intersection. I was about a quarter mile down this road when I see in my rear view mirror another car or truck coming up behind me as I was going up the first hill on this stretch of road. I was about halfway up this hill when this they passed me. As I crested the hill, I was expecting to see them going down the hill or on the short straightway to the next hill, but I did not see any taillights. So, I slowed down thinking they went off the road and crashed. As I was coming down the hill, I was looking for the car/truck that passed me, but I couldn't see much of anything, so I stopped at the bottom of the hill and put my 4ways on.  I got out of my truck with my flashlight and started to walk up the hill scanning the side of road to see if I didn't find anything. I ended up reaching the top of the hill without finding any trace of the vehicle that passed me.

SpookySpunkyArt,None,False,False,True,10jexgu,False,False,t3_10jexgu,A Haunting in Mississippi,"I will be making edits to this story, as I gather facts and get the stories straight from my family.

I have a few family members that used to live in Mississippi, and a few of the houses in these different towns were haunted. For the sake of my family's privacy I won't be naming the towns.

Every summer in the early 2000s, for about 4 years, my childhood summer vacation would be predictable: ""Let's go see (insert family member's name) in Mississippi!"" And I dreaded it. It wasn't that I didn't want to see them, it was the HEAT. The almost unbearable hot Mississippi heat and the stench of something rotten on the wind whenever it blew by, pretty sure it was the Mississippi mud though. Also there was really not much at all to do in these two different towns the times we went to Mississippi. The library or park, take your pick. Also the traveling distance from our home to these towns was LONG and was a cramped car ride with other family!

I'll start with the first house in the first town, that I remember first seeing when we would visit. First off the vibes were off. Being in the place you had a funny feeling of not being wanted, said family member married a guy that already had kids that were grown, and still living with them, but her husband and his kids did NOT like us being there, can't say I liked them either but we only seen said family member once a year, so they had to deal. But it wasn't just her step kids and husband that were off, the place felt off. 
My grandma stayed in the stepsister's room while she stayed I believe at her mom's house the week we were there. There was this long hallway that connected two rooms, her room and another room. It was like a closet/storage space, but I would always think that was a very weird thing, a closed hallway that connected two rooms? And it was built that way, I've never heard of another room having this feature apart from real old houses (this house wasn't very old, it was built I'm guessing late 80s).
Well my grandma heard scratching from behind that door. Like someone was in there scratching with their nails. Also my family member we visited? Her and her husband's room was the other room connected and she heard it, and it scared her so bad she put a heavy trunk, and other junk in front of that door so that way nothing could come out. If I remember right those doors also had locks so they stayed locked.
The family member we visited, she had also seen things in that house before we got there. Things that would make your hair stand on end. She says she seen something that looked like Gollum from LOTR crawl the ceiling, looking right at her while she was in bed with her husband, in the dim light. Scared her really bad.

Beside this fireplace in the living room, on both sides was openings, doorways to go into the kitchen, so basically two open ways that lead from the living room to the kitchen. My mom was walking the length behind the fireplace where the kitchen was. My grandma said in the first doorway she saw her as a little girl skipping along out of the corner of her eye, wearing a pink frilly, old timey dress, and blond curled hair, and this little girl was skipping. When my mom made it to the other doorway it was my mom again, not the little girl. Suddenly Mom told Grandma, ""Just then I had the weirdest feeling, I felt like I was a little girl again, with not a care in the world!""
Then Grandma said, ""You're not going to believe this, but I SAW you as a little girl!"" 
Needless to say they both were freaked out. The little girl that Grandma saw, did not look like Mom when she was little, but I believe what happened was a ghost of a little girl possessed my mother for a few seconds.
Just recently I showed a bunch of old timey pictures of girl's dresses to my grandma to try and narrow down the timeline that girl was from. I put together a drawing of how my grandma described her, but I will post it later. She said it looks exactly what she had seen.
There was a sun room in the house. This happened only one time, but there was sounds of something banging, like literally someone was in there throwing crap in that room, like lawn chairs, or whatever. Everyone went to check and there was nothing, nobody. Mom and Grandma slept with the lights on, ceiling lights, all night. Matter of fact they barely slept.
The story behind that house was that the guy that had it before them, well his wife went missing. Gone. And I think people thought for while he murdered her, and hid the body. On the property? Who knows.

A few years later, our family member and her ""wonderful"" stepkids and husband moved to another house in a different town.
This I do remember: late at night, when everyone was in bed we all heard something roll up and down the hallway like a ball. My family member's daughter had a a little tricycle that she rode around in the house so that was maybe what we heard.
We only heard it one night but it was enough.

I can't really remember what else happened in that house but I'm sure there were other things.

After few years the summers in Mississippi stopped, another chapter closed in my childhood. Said family member divorced, and moved her and her daughter, and we've never been back to Mississippi since.",12,32.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10jexgu/a_haunting_in_mississippi/,False,2023-01-23 15:20:35,False,False,False,0.94,,,,
RandomNYCx,None,False,False,False,10j8ot4,False,False,t3_10j8ot4,Old Haunting,"When i was a child i had two separate experiences that may have been supernatural or may have simply been my mind playing tricks on me however when i was about 18 or 19 i experienced something that was definitely supernatural.  

On the southern tip of Staten Island there lies the Conference House and its surrounding park.  Up until the early 2000s there was about a half a dozen houses on Parks Department grounds that were vacated and demolished so that they could make walking trails and such.   An ex-girlfriend of mine has lived in one of these houses with her mother and sisters. 

When i would spend the night i would share the pull out bed with her in the living room.  However there was one night where it was particularly hot so we went upstairs and slept in her sisters’ bedroom since it was cooler in there and they wouldn’t be home that night.  For what ever reason i couldn’t sleep comfortably that night.  I would wake up and just look out towards the window across the room.  Around the third i woke up, i saw something standing between the bed and the window, nearer to the window.   

I was told this house was haunted and in the year and a half since i started hanging out there with my ex and her sisters i had never seen anything.  So this one night, i see standing near the window a silhouette of a human figure.   It was just standing there.  Even though the room was dark there was still enough moon light illuminating the room yet what i saw was pitch black.   I’m talking as black as black can be.  I was not able to make out any facial distinctions, it was like devoid of anything human.  It really was just a black silhouette and it was terrifying.  

After staring at this entity for what seemed like forever or just three seconds i woke up my then girlfriend.   I asked if she was seeing what i was seeing and she did.   I quickly asked what should we do and she said we should go downstairs to which all i could say was “ok”. 

Luckily the door to the hallway was about two feet away the bed on her side.  After she got up i quickly followed.  Instead of getting up on my side which would have placed me between the foot of the bed and the entity, i rolled across the bed and hurried on my way out never looking back.   

That was the one and only time i ever experienced anything in that house but that moment has stayed with me for nearly twenty years.  Even though those houses were demolished in the early 2000s, i don’t dare walk down that block at night.",7,42.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10j8ot4/old_haunting/,False,2023-01-23 09:41:03,False,False,False,0.95,,,,
EasternTune4592,None,False,False,False,10jax24,False,False,t3_10jax24,One of my experiences from living in a haunted house,"I grew up in the 90’s in Minnesota.
My parents divorced when I was 8, and we spent every other weekend at my dads haunted house in East Bethel.

This house had every type of ghost you could think of- a shadow man in a trench coat and brimmed hat, another separate shadow figure that danced down the hallway,  a man dressed to go fishing, a doppelgänger of my father, 2 giggling little girl ghosts, and many other unseen entities.

The dishwasher, radios, and lights would turn themselves on and off randomly. Loud banging would be heard on walls and doors.
Door handles would jiggle and turn on their own. Feelings of being touched or caressed in the shower were reported.

My father also had an incident where he felt someone crawl into bed with him in the middle of the night when he was the only one home.

My uncle reported hearing 2 little girls giggling and singing in the basement one night while sleeping downstairs. Upon awakening the next morning, he discovered there were no kids in the house that night.

(Also there was a salamander plague one night. The entire yard was covered in slimy, slithering salamanders. It only ever happened once. Not positive if that is paranormal, but it’s certainly strange.)

One sunny Saturday morning while visiting my dad my brother and I were up early watching cartoons. I was 8 years old and my brother was 3.  As we sat on the couch we heard 3 knocking sounds on the wall 5-6 feet behind us.

Knock
Knock
Knock

Our heads quickly snapped back to look at the wall where the sound was coming from, but we saw nothing.

My brother and I quickly turned to look at each other with frightened eyes.
I, being the older sister, tried to be brave. I told him it was nothing.

As we turn our attention back to the cartoons, my little 8 year old brain is spinning. “What if that banging noise we just heard wasn’t ‘just the pipes’ as I had been told so many times? What it it was a ghost? I hate when the ghosts come around…Why isn’t my dad around whenever this happens?”

As these thoughts swirl in my head we hear it again.

Knock
Knock
Knock

This time it is coming from somewhere in the kitchen off to our left. It’s not as loud as the first time and the sound is different. Like someone is knocking on the kitchen counter this time instead of the wall.

We quickly strain our necks to peek inside the kitchen with lightening speed to catch whomever or whatever is making that noise. Again, there is nothing there.

I take a deep breath. Once again I pretended to be brave and tell me brother, “It’s nothing. Just ignore it.”

My heart is thumping in my chest and there are butterflies in my tummy as the familiar anxiety grows worse with each passing second.

I tuck myself up on the couch in a ball, not wanting my legs to dangle off the edge. I no longer feel safe. Nothing is to be trusted.

Knock
Knock
Knock

This time the sound is coming from the dining room.
I can tell the noise is coming from the wooden dining table this time.

I can see the entire table from where I am sitting with ease and there is nothing on the table that should be making that noise. No one except me and my brother are awake. There is no one in the dining room. There is no logical reason for this knocking noise that is moving around us.

Just then I realize the knocking sounds have been moving in a big circle around us. If this invisible entity is to move any closer to us, the next logical place for it to be would be in the living room where me and my brother are currently sitting. 

No sooner than that thought crossed my mind it happened again.

Knock
Knock
Knock

This time the noise was coming from the coffee table sitting less than 1 foot away from us.

I Instantly flip over the back of my couch in a reverse somersault like motion, and run at super human speed to my fathers bedroom.
In my panic I completely left my little 3 year old brother behind to fend for himself. Luckily he wasn’t too far behind.

We sneak into our fathers room, and quietly lay on the floor. Our dad would have been super pissed if we woke him up early on a Saturday morning, even for a ghost. In our commotion we wake up our 6 year sister who is sleeping on our dads floor. (Us 3 kids always slept on his floor together when we were visiting.)

So we quietly whisper what just happened out in the living room to our sister. 

As we are telling her this story, something catches our eye. We can see a black shadow under the small space between the bottom of the door and the plush carpet. This black shadow is slowly pacing back and forth in the hallway just on the other side of the bedroom door.

Back and forth. Back and forth. Back and forth.
Like this shadow is waiting for us....

Unfortunately I don’t remember what happened after this point. Somehow the rest of that memory has been lost with time. But I know for sure we DIDN’T open that door.

As an adult I often wish I would have been “brave” and opened the door. What would have been waiting? Would the entity have entered the room and attacked? Would we have been shocked and confused to find the hallway empty? Would the gray shadow just keep pacing the hallway, oblivious to to our frightened curious eyes?

If you get this far, thank you for reading my story! I can’t wait to read your comments. I’ve shared this story specifically on a few podcasts. This was one of three of my personal scariest experiences living in this house. 

I’ve done A LOT of research on the home and property over the years, and can’t find any evidence of a death, or tragedy that would account for so much paranormal activity.

I’ve also reached out to previous and current owners to see if they had any strange experiences. The two families who lived there previously said they never had any strange experiences. Neither did the family who lived their right after my family. The family currently living there did not respond to my questions, and in hindsight, I regret even asking them. It wasn’t cool of me to even put that thought in their head.

Prior to the home being built, all I can find is that the land the house sits on was part of a farm for a family that I could find little information on.

Single-Perception660,None,False,False,True,10j9dl5,False,False,t3_10j9dl5,HER,"
I’ll be honest with you. I’m not sure how to start but, my wife called me a few days ago. She said that she dreamt about me being in bed with another woman. 

I won’t cheat on my wife and I haven’t. Ever.  Anyhow, it’s been 5 days. 5 days since I last slept and I don’t know what to do. The thing is I have never had to deal with anything like this in my life so I decided to contact my doctor and made an appointment. The days leading up to the appointment were terrifying. Every night I woke up, maybe, 30 minutes or an hour after going to sleep.I would lay in bed for hours just staring at the ceiling or playing with my cat and this would go own for two weeks. That is, until 6 nights ago.

Let me give you some kind of background. I live in upstate New York. Well not live, more like stationed;. I live on the area known as old post and it’s fairly far from my work area.  I have seen many things that you cannot explain. Hell I can’t even explain myself. I’m in school for my physicians license and psychology is a part of the course, yet I still can’t make any logic of what I seen. There were times I would see people standing at my door or in my vicinity that weren’t really there. Sounds like I’m going insane, I know. Although there are multiple accounts other than my own to verify the things I was seeing were indeed true.

Getting back to my story, to the reason I’m writing this. The day my wife called me, I was probably on my 2nd or 3rd day of not sleeping. I can’t tell you why I haven’t been able to sleep seeing as its my first time going through this. Yeah, “Google it”, is something most people would say or  recommend. I did and believe me you it didn’t work. It’s been 3 weeks, 3 fucking weeks man this shit is getting ridiculous.I started seeing a figure at my door every night. It has a feminine sillouette and just sits there every night staring at me with her glowing white eyes. “Maybe my mind is playing ticks on me right?”, I thought but, why am I seeing this every night?
I have a roommate because my wife isn’t here (that’s a whole different issue) and he’s only staying here because he can’t move into the barracks just yet due to his divorce. The thing is why did he wake me up last night asking about the girl in the house?

THERE IS NO GIRL IN THIS FUCKING HOUSE!!

I got a cat and it’s male. Why is some female that either of us know or have anything to do with in my house?
Yet she just sits in my doorway staring. She gets closer every night and I’m not sure what to do. My roommate see’s her standing outside my door every night and he doesn’t know what to do. Neither do I. All of this is too much and I don’t how to get her out of my house. If anybody has an answer.

I just want to write it to see if anyone seen anything similar. So me and my boyfriend went to park at a parking lot right by a church. We were in his jeep facing the church and he was telling me his past life story and I was listening to him talk because it was something heavy that was on his chest that he felt he needed to let out to me. so he works night shift and was on a break so he gets a call to go back to work at 3 so we are pulling out of the parking lot and we notice three deer and there was an alleyway that went towards the direction to where you can get a good glance at them. My boyfriend asked me if we should pull in to see these deer. So I said yes and we did and parked there for a minute staring at these deer and two of them were male and the one was female but kept walking while the other two male deer stopped and stared. We just looked at them and was like cool and then we backed out with the headlights facing towards the third deer standing there. we stopped and my boyfriend stared at it and said that’s an ugly weird looking deer and I looked and it did not look normal at all. It stared back at us but this stare looked so eerie. This deer had a white face from the bottom to its eyes and it’s nose was pushed downwards like a flat face. The eyes were facing directly straight to us and not sideways as a normal deer would have. The body was that of a deer and my boyfriend continued to stare and examine the deer and I was questioning like is that a deer or a different animal? and he’s like no that’s a deer. I stared at it and I told my boyfriend why are we staring at it and I looked away because I didn’t want to stare at it anymore. And I told him to go and we left and I was like “that deer did not look normal” and he was like “you seen that too right?” and I had the chills all the way back home. He told me to not tell anyone what we saw and tried to convince me that we only seen two male deer and not the third one to help me feel not as scared considering I was going home alone.. I got home safe and went right to sleep. The next morning me and my boyfriend talked about it and agreed what we both saw and then stopped talking about it because I can still see how it looked in my mind.. but that’s my story it just been so on my mind because I never seen anything like that in my life… we are next to a reservation where we were and

Bombchop,None,False,False,False,10iiv7v,False,False,t3_10iiv7v,My first ever unexplained experience.,"When I was around 11-12 years old living in the UK, I went through a period of 4 months, where at night I could never sleep all the way through at home. No matter how tired I was or what time I went to bed, I would always wake up around 2-3am. If I slept at my grandmother's house, no problems at all.

Every night that I woke up, it would be silent in the house except for a light tapping sound coming from the corner of my bedroom, where my wardrobe used to be. Every night, I would hear this tapping noise and it would keep me from being able to fall back to sleep, in part because I was absolute pooping my pants.

The tapping sound was never continuous, it would tap for different lengths of time then stop, before continuing again. This counted out my mother's, 'it must be next door neighbors clock', when I told her all about it. 'Creaking wardrobe doors' and 'just my imagination' were 2 other explanations that my Mother gave me. Also, I'd use that wardrobe daily, when getting changed into fresh clothes and nothing seemed out of the ordinary.

I remember 1 night, I decided enough was enough. I had spent about an hour lying in bed listening to the tapping and struggling to sleep. I jumped out of bed and went over to my wardrobe, grasped both of the handles and flung the doors open. There was a pause for about 1 minute while I had the handles in my hands, once again pooping myself. As the doors flung open, a t-shirt that I'd had on 1 of my hangers hit me in the face and I had a feeling like something had punched me in the stomach.

I remember lying on the floor in my room, not sure how long for but it was like time just jumped forward 3 hours and my parents were getting up for work. I said nothing and went about my day as if nothing had happened. That was the last night that I ever woke up in the early hours of the morning and last time I ever heard that tapping sound.

As I've grew older, I've spoken to my Mother about it all and she has told me many stories about our old house and I have returned the favor with my other experiences. She said that because I was young and got scared easy, she always tried to find a rational excuse for whatever spooky scenario I ever told her I was in.

**Where Do Items Go – The Missing Keys by Keith Linder**

For millennia one of the questions surrounding poltergeists regarding missing items in homes is where do the “missing items go?” Nearly every case on record has reports of items disappearing e.g., family heirlooms, jewelry, silverware, personal belongings, electronics, etc.   Some are never to be found.  Several theories (one, in particular, I subscribe to) say the items never left, there are still within the house. Out of reach and out of sight from the house occupants. Some believe the items are appearing in other people’s homes.  Appearing elsewhere.  If you consider, the stories of items appearing inexplicably in homes that no one inside the house owns there might be some truth to that.   And with good reason. With good evidence. Evidence from the Bothell house. And from other poltergeist cases, I might add.  But there’s a third theory, a subset of the 2nd theory I just mentioned.  Items that go missing are often found elsewhere in the home.  Sometimes immediate, other times within days, weeks, months, and yes even years.   The items found in other parts of the home after it’s been registered as missing is almost always out of place suggesting it was strategically placed.  **Example No 1.** One of the weirdest phenomena Tina and I experienced while living in the Bothell home was the incident where we woke up in the morning and found kid toys placed dead center on the steps of our staircase. Kid toys on the coffee table. Kid toys on countertops.  We don’t have kids.  It doesn’t take a rocket science to know these toys were put in places where they would be noticed immediately.  But that’s benign activity.  The more sinister example I have of an item gone missing only to return to a different location inside our home. **Example No 2.** is the bible that went missing inside our home summer of 2012.  I placed this bible on the lamp table of our living room downstairs – it was gone the next morning.  When did it return? Spring 2014.  Not only was it returned in a different location of the home which was right outside our master bedroom doorway. But it was returned on fire.  I think we all can agree there’s not a more frightening experience inside your home than waking up to a fire you had no role in starting. Items reported missing in poltergeist-infested homes only to appear elsewhere inside the home point to intelligence.  An entity with the ability to know the difference between good and evil and in doing so ignites a bible on fire at the base of our doorway while we slept is a deliberate act. A calculated act. If that doesn’t run in contradiction to R.S.P.K I don’t know what does. But the third example I want to provide the example I believe the paranormal community has grossly ignored or worse isn’t prepared to deal with involves my missing car keys (key fob).   Within days of moving into the Bothell home one of the first (if not the first) things I noticed to go missing was my spare key fob a.k.a car keys.  This car key fob I kept in a plastic glove box about the size of a six-inch shoe box.  Inside this plastic glove box is where I kept my personal items. Items like Star Wars cards, comic book cards, and personal information e.g., birth certificates and family photos.  One day I went to retrieve an item out of my glove box, and it was then I noticed my spare car fob was missing.  How can something I never used be missing?   Fast forward to a few months later.  Something very peculiar and uncanny started happening.  Those who’ve survived a poltergeist haunting will tell you poltergeists are exploiters of the everyday routine of humans.  It’s one of their primary modus operandi – something that fits the description given by many of being a “trickster.”  It became irritable to me but at the same time dismissive – me leaving for work each morning and within seconds of entering my car seeing that my car trunk was open i.e., unlocked.   It had to have been the middle of 2013 when I noticed my car trunk was always unlocked (not open, just unlocked) when I would leave for work in the morning. The first time I noticed my trunk was unlocked was when I got into the car, and before starting it up, I would see the trunk light lit on my dashboard. That icon, if lit, means your trunk is open. Not important, I’ll just get out of my car and raise the trunk, slam it down—problem solved. Weird? Why do I find myself doing this two to three times a week now? I’m thinking somehow, some way, I’m fat-fingering my key fob. What does fat-fingering mean? Fat-fingering is when you inaccurately strike two keys at the same time with one finger. It’s not a huge inconvenience to get back out of your car, walk to the car trunk, raise the trunk itself, and slam it shut. A few seconds is all it takes. Not a huge inconvenience if it happens now and then. Three times a week? What’s up with that? A year or so later, **I’m still asking myself the question, why is my trunk light always on?** Why is it always open, i.e., unlocked, before I get into it each morning? What’s going on? My routine each morning, when I leave for work, is very simple.  I kiss Tina goodbye and close the house front door behind me. I get to my car, climb into my seat, and there on my dashboard is the trunk light. It’s lit. Nothing weird about that if it happens once. Nothing weird about that if it happens several times through the course of your lifetime. It’s been happening to me three or four times a week for over a year. I feel stupid for not realizing it sooner. The spirits have been using my spare car key fob.  They’ve been hitting the “unlock trunk” button on the key fob. They’ve been doing this within seconds of me walking out the front door. Up until now, I thought I was fat-fingering my key fob.  I was wrong.  How do I know it was them doing this? Well, they made a mistake, which is extremely rare. I left for work one morning like I always do. I get all the way to the car door and then realize I don’t have my keys on me. I left it in the house. But guess what? I’m standing at my car door. I can see my dashboard. Why is my trunk light lit? How can my trunk light be on when I don’t even have my keys on me?  I haven’t unlocked my car door yet.  That’s when I realized. I haven’t been fat-fingering my car fob at all. It would seem I ignored my intuition a year or so ago when I asked the rhetorical question: why am I always doing this?   Given the location of the trunk button on the car key fob?  Where it’s located makes fat-fingering unlikely if not impossible. One’s finger would deliberately have to go out of its way to touch the ‘trunk unlock’ button. Not only that, but you also must hold it down considerably longer to activate it.  When you look at it from a scientific or psychological point of view it’s hard not to appreciate the knowledge about poltergeists being revealed here.   **Somewhere we can’t see for lack of a better word a spirit is operating the missing car key fob it stole from me.**  The Occam’s Razor loyalists of the world will say ‘it’s Tina, Tina’s the culprit’ they overlook the fact that Tina didn’t know my extra key fob existed, let alone knew where it was and **#2** she sometimes left the house before me or was out of town. It’s not a leap to believe my spare car key fob (the one I never used) that went missing hours after I moved into the Bothell house is the device being used to unlock my car trunk.  That’s not a supposition.   Another revelation would be my dismissiveness.  A dismissiveness that I’m embarrassed to admit lasted for over a year. But here begins the lesson.   The poltergeist in question needs my level of dismissiveness to carry out its work.   All poltergeists do.  Those familiar with me and Tina’s ordeal have heard me say over and over the times I’ve come back to my office, or bedroom and found the room light off.  I could have sworn I had left the light on.  Who turns a light off in a room if they know there immediately coming back?  I know I don’t. The same thing can be said about the television.  Who turns their television off before they leave a room if they know they’re coming right back. I don’t.  But! And this is a huge but.   Maybe I did turn it off?  That’s the level of dismissiveness I believe science needs to analyze and doing so will help us better understand the nature of poltergeists.   That dismissiveness applies to asporting and the apporting of objects.  It’s impossible to know every item missing in the Bothell house simply for the fact some items are just too insignificant to remember. As are some of the items that inexplicably appeared. The third revelation I want to talk about the one I feel the paranormal community ignores is the amount of observation being levied here.  This campaign of me getting into my car each morning and discovering my car trunk door open or unlocked went on for over a year.  A huge portion of it happened when the house was least active.  I’m talking about when there was no activity in the house whatsoever.   I’m often asked this question and it angers me internally (*but I try not to show it*) have I heard from the current occupiers of the home?  My answer is no I have not.   Some people believe it would strengthen me and Tina’s claims if the current occupiers of the Bothell house stepped forth with similar claims.   That’s not how poltergeists conduct their business.   The events that made our case famous I’m talking about the three bibles that caught fire, and wall writings is not the baseline activity.   The definition of a baseline is the “minimum or starting point.”   The minimum starting point with most poltergeists and by most, I mean 99% is the activity house occupants might not even notice. Objects disappearing, phantom noises, knocking, strange sounds, electrical issues e.g., phantom doorbell ring, TV turning off and on, lights going on/off or off/on, battery drainage, appliance malfunction, etc.  Most of these things can be easily dismissed as ‘just one of those things’ and rightfully so. But not all the time. It’s my belief that most poltergeist cases go undetected and unreported.   Parapsychologists Steve Mera said it best when he said, ‘it’s possible the current occupiers of the home will have things happen and just not know it.’  The activity I regard as baseline activity camouflages itself extremely well in the things we consider routine.  I can’t tell you how many times I had a certified electrician over to troubleshoot the house’s electrical system only to find nothing wrong. How many times have we had the cable guy over. How many times have we had the appliance mechanic over.   How many times have we had the ADT security guy over. How many times have we had Verizon over. How many times have we had Comcast, now Xfinity over. How many times have we had the utility company over to investigate things.  Nothing was ever found wrong or out of the ordinary.   “You can’t fix what’s not broken,” was what they all said.   The spirits in question never entertained the possibility that I might forget my car keys(fob) one day.  Had I had my car keys(fob) on me I would have still been dismissive.  Their level of observation, the desire to observe me leaving the house each morning, and in doing so they unlock the trunk of my car for almost two years unabated not only speaks to a level of trickery, observation, patience, commitment – dedication.   That’s the point I want to bring home for all who read this. Study this.  Read the three books I’ve written. Re-read the cases you’ve already studied or acquired.  Ask the house occupants (your open cases) to tell you things they have not told you. Do all of that and more and you’ll begin. BEGIN TO SEE. We’re dealing with intelligent; 3rd party entities. Not R.S.P.K.  So, where is my car key fob? I never recovered it. It was never given back to me.  What happened to the other items that went missing in the home?  Where do these items go?  I believe these items are *on the person* of the spirit themselves.  A vale i.e. hidden curtain shrouds their basic makeup. It keeps them and the items they steal hidden from us.  These items that go missing the world over are not sitting in some poltergeist cave or poltergeist storage facility.   Nor are they in the crawl spaces or cavities of the home.   Science tells us there are dimensions, the majority of them hidden that we can’t even begin to comprehend let alone see that exist within millimeters of each of us.  Don’t like to talk about dimensions?   You feel that’s sci/fi?   Then how about spectrums of light? Think about it “our visual system can paint a vibrant portrait of the world, its palette of colors is quite limited, as we only see between 390 to 750 nm of the full electromagnetic spectrum while the remaining trillion wavelengths escape our view. Infrared waves are a portion of the light spectrum that follows red. They have longer wavelengths than visible light, ranging from 700 nanometers to one millimeter. This renders them invisible to humans in almost all conditions.”  That’s just one example.  My conclusion being humans with the naked eye don’t come close to seeing everything in existence.  Some of these missing items are still in the home.  Tina, I, and anyone else for that matter are just blind to them.   I believe some items that went missing are appearing or will reappear in the Bothell house(remember the letters from previous tenants reappearing in kitchen drawers after Tina and I moved in – drawers that were occupied with stuff we put in) and other homes throughout the world for that matter. Some items will reappear in the neighborhood the Bothell house is in if not already.   If we study carefully what the entity said in the Blair Witch house to John Bell and others – combine what it said with the findings in the Bothell house and add in the info from other poltergeist cases it’s intelligent to believe items poltergeists take in one house do or can reappear in other homes. ",2,15.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/10i21p4/the_missing_keycar_key_fob/,False,2023-01-21 21:22:40,False,False,False,0.87,,,,

RealistH8er,None,False,False,False,10h68el,False,False,t3_10h68el,Demonic Oppression,"Background

I am a professional Paranormal researcher with over forty years experience. I hold many degrees and certifications that aide me in my research, some strictly paranormal in nature other more general in nature. This is a true story of my personal experience being oppressed by a demon, how it felt, what I did to resolve it and similarities to other cases that I have worked. This is written from a personal perspective, meaning that my personal beliefs, theories, and hypothesis are included. I am a non-denominational Christian, paranormal believer, Pastoral Counselor and Minister. These are my beliefs and only included to provide a basis for the ideas that I express here.

The Experience

I began to have trouble sleeping, emotional outbursts, severe mood swings, and feelings of impending doom. This went on for two weeks before I took any action as I believed it to be related to the many health issues. I visited my doctor who ordered blood work and related tests which all turned out normal. At six weeks I had exhausted all of my personal resources to address this issue. I did not jump to a paranormal issue immediately but, I did attempt to intervene personally using my spiritual beliefs and practices. This did provide some relief to varying degrees, but only lasted for short intervals from a couple of hours to a few days. Eventually I sought the help of another minister that I trust. He felt that he should perform a minor exorcism to see what effect that it may have on the situation. I am very lucky to have another professional available that I have a personal relationship with. His familiarity with me and my experience personally validated his concerns and gave him the confidence to proceed much faster than the process normally takes.

During the exorcism the demon identified itself by name. It stated that it was given the authority to afflict me by God. It also stated that I had invited it because I was punishing myself. I have no memory of this at all, but it did speak using my voice. By name he cast it out in the name of Jesus and followed his protocol for these type of situations. After it was over I felt immediate relief. He questioned me extensively on how I may have been punishing myself. It was very hard to admit for me especially in my position as a pastoral counselor that I had a lot of guilt for things that had occurred in my life. Some things that I had done and other things that had been done to me. He counseled me for several weeks to deal with these issues so that this would not happen to me again.

Questions

As a result of this whole experience I have questions. This was a demon and though it was oppressing me, it seems that it was for my own good? I have seen this in helping other people in a general sense, but based on experiences that you may have had, is this the norm? Is the mind part of the spirit? I have seen during paranormal investigations that entities carry with them mental afflictions that they had in life. Should there be more investigation from a para-psychological point of view in all cases?

Glittering-Rip4422,None,False,False,False,10glspi,False,False,t3_10glspi,My childhood house was haunted/possessed,"I was born in London. We moved to many places around the city. When I was roughly 6 years old, my dad began to teach me how to pray before bed. We practiced for the night and I went to sleep. During the night, I woke up randomly. I turned around (was facing the wall) and there was someone there, standing at the side of my bed. As soon as I saw the legs, it ran away at a freakishly fast speed out of my room. I immediately threw myself under my blankets and went back to sleep to try and get it out of my mind. The next day, I told my parents and my dad was freaked out. He knew it was satan/ the devil sending a demon to sway my belief in prayer. I didn’t have an experience for a while. I moved to Jacksonville, Florida a few years later. All was good for a few weeks after the move until it was nighttime again and I was praying. During my prayer, there was massive knocking on the ceiling of my bedroom. I immediately sprinted to my parents room and explained it. They said they didn’t hear anything, but they believed me. I slept in their room for the night. I woke up randomly to loud banging coming up the stairs. Both of my parents were beside me and I don’t have any siblings. I woke my dad up and he told me that we need to pray, which we did. After that night, I began to hear something every single night. It began with just knocking, but increased in intensity to the point of my door being slammed whenever I was sleeping. My dad had us consul in a priest, who told us that this was likely a demon known as a family demon, a demon that haunts a family for many generations.

ReadyFaithlessness22,None,False,False,True,10fjid1,False,False,t3_10fjid1,I talked to a ghost when I was little,"Hi all, this is one of my favorite stories to tell lol. I don't remember it as I was young, so it's all just regurgitated from what my grandma has told me.

When I was about 4, my grandparents moved out of their old house and moved into the house we live in now. They sold their old house quicker than expected, meaning they were on a time crunch to find a new house. They did the first showing of our house, and everything was normal. They were interested, and returned the next day for a second walkthrough and found a dead crow in the living room. The doors, windows, and chimney were closed and locked, and they had no idea how this crow had gotten inside, let alone died. They looked past that and bought the house.

On our first day in the house, my grandma and I were going to sleep in the living room, and my grandpa was going to sleep with the dog in the master bedroom. At about 11 in the night, my grandma got up to go to the bathroom, and not long after, I followed her to tell her that there was a man in the living room that wanted to talk to her (apparently I said I had no idea who the man was). Again, I have no recollection of this. Obviously freaked out, she checked all the doors and windows which were locked, and she had no clue how someone could've gotten in. The next morning, at about 4am, the dog (who was locked in the master bedroom) woke my grandma and I up licking our faces. When my grandma asked my grandpa why she let the dog out of the room, he told her he hadn't been out of bed yet and had no idea how the dog got out.

I also had a magnet that you had to push to light up. The only way it would light up is if you pushed it. My grandma came home from work one day to find the magnet lighting up on the fridge. She said she sat on the porch until my grandpa got home because she was too scared to go inside by herself lol.

Over the next couple weeks, strange things would happen like the over turning on and off, the tv turning on and off, we always smelled whiskey and cigars, despite no one smoking cigars in the house, and my grandma always had the sense she was being watched.

After they were completely settled in and everything was finalized, one day while my grandpa was doing yard work, a neighbor walked up and asked him ""Has weird stuff been happening in your house?"" My grandpa responded, ""yes, how'd you know?"" To which the neighbor replied, ""The last owner died of alcohol poisoning in the master bedroom"". The house was sold by the homeowner's mom, so she was never required to disclose that information.

Sometimes we'll get hints of the ghost, but other than that he is pretty quiet. If we talk about it a door will open or something, but he's thankfully pretty friendly overall.

paranormah,None,False,False,False,10f0dgo,False,False,t3_10f0dgo,I heard footsteps in the middle of the night,"This is my first time posting to this sub, but I wanted to share this story (I have *a lot*, but this was one of the more memorable experiences). It won’t be terribly long, but it was definitely one of the creepiest encounters I’ve had. Also, excuse any grammatical or spelling errors you might come across. I’m typing this out on my phone.

A little information, my best friend has a ghost attachment. It’s been with her family for years—we’re still trying to figure out what it is and how to get rid of it. But needless to say, the enter time I’ve been friends with her, I’ve encountered so much activity. This just happened to be one of the creepiest.

So, my friend and I moved in with each other into a basement suite. We were both pretty broke at the time, so it was only one-bedroom. I took up residence on the couch, and slept in the living room—which made it my bedroom. Our suite is shaped like an L, you walk in, you’re in the kitchen, on the other side of the room is the living room, beside that is the laundry room which is connected to my friends room and the bathroom.

Hopefully that description made some sense. So, one night, I had settled down for the evening—I’m the type to have to contemplate the meaning of life so I can fall asleep. I started hearing soft taps coming from the living room. They were slow, but then it got to the living and I heard the unmistakable sounds of footsteps.

We had cheap laminate flooring, which accentuated every step the thing took. I could tell it was trying to be quiet and once it made it to the middle of three living room, it stopped. I became very aware of a presence and I felt like I was being watched. I absolutely *refused* to open my eyes. I thought if I pretended I didn’t hear anything, it would leave me alone. 

After a long time of tense silence, I somehow fell asleep and woke up the next morning rather confused. I know, for a fact, those footsteps weren’t from my roommate. I’ve known her long enough to recognize her footsteps. These ones were different. I kind of regret not opening my eyes, but I’m glad too. It was pitch black in the living room, I’m not sure I’d even be able to see it, even if it was standing there.

That’s the only time I’ve ever heard footsteps, but damn, it was creepy.

HauntingHappenings,None,False,False,False,11mon6l,False,False,t3_11mon6l,The Ghost in the Woods," I love walking in the woods but some strange things have happened in the woods. Have you had anything weird happen to you? This was one of the strangest things that happened to me. 

It was a beautiful day for a hike in the woods, so I grabbed my backpack and set out on the trail. The sun was shining, the birds were singing, and the leaves rustled gently in the breeze.

As I walked deeper into the forest, I noticed that the sounds of nature had grown quieter. It was as if the forest was holding its breath, waiting for something to happen.

That's when I saw her. A woman dressed in white, standing at the edge of a clearing. She looked like she was from another time, with a long flowing dress and a ribbon tied around her waist.

At first, I thought she might be lost or in trouble, so I approached her cautiously. But as I got closer, she vanished into thin air, leaving only the sound of rustling leaves behind.

I was shaken, but I couldn't shake the feeling that I needed to follow her. So I continued on the trail, my heart pounding in my chest.

As I approached the clearing where I had seen the woman, I heard the faint sound of music. It was a haunting melody, played on a violin.

I stepped into the clearing and saw her again, the woman in white, dancing to the music of an unseen player. She twirled and spun, her dress billowing in the breeze.

But then, as suddenly as before, she vanished again, leaving me alone in the clearing.

I left the woods that day feeling haunted by the memory of the ghostly woman in white.

None of which have yielded any sort of evidence. A part of me wants to believe but also terrified at the prospect of witnessing something. I was mostly a non-believer up until a couple of months ago.

In short, I had wanted to plan a surprise party and getaway for my girlfriend’s 30th birthday. She had mentioned wanting to go hit the slopes (it was January so it’s still winter time at this point). I organized this months ahead and had invited some of her closest friends to join. I ended up renting an AirBnB cabin that had enough rooms to house 10 people (or 5 couples). One entire lower floor basement level with two beds, a room on the first floor, and 3 rooms upstairs. Also adding that this cabin was in a beautiful rural neighborhood in Tahoe, CA with tons of cabins next door, down the street, adjacent, etc. so there’s plenty of housing around us. Nothing peculiar about it and there are other people staying around. Of course, my gf and I take the master bedroom upstairs and right across the hall is another couple in one room, and my gf’s cousin by herself in the 3rd room next door. All rooms are taken and the middle floor is a lively area with games, a fireplace, and a foosball table. These details are somewhat relevant and important later in my story.

The first night was a night of merry drinking and games. To celebrate the occasion, we had decorated the living area and blown up balloons to be loosely strewn around the large and cozy living room and family room where we imbibed. Almost uneventful with respect to weird happenings. Except towards the end of the night balloons would randomly pop at odd intervals. Someone in our group suggested it was the balloons getting attracted towards the heater vents and popping. I was dismissive of this because not all of them that popped were congregated near vents… cool… I just took note. Didn’t want to argue or suggest anything weird at this point. After we all retired for the night and all the lights were off, we could hear balloons pop downstairs at random intervals that reverberated through the silent house. This happened between 2:00-3:30am. The next morning, still plenty of healthy balloons strewn about. 

Fast forward to night 2, after we return from snow activities we prep for drinking and the usual. After a full day’s worth of shredding the snow, we are all collectively tired a bit earlier than the previous night and decide to retire around 11:30-midnight. Here’s where I personally experienced things that got me feeling irked… 

Since it was cold, I decide to go downstairs to turn on the thermostat/heater. Our couple friends across the hall had their door slightly open ajar, lights were on, and bathroom was in use. As I am going downstairs in the dark stairwell I hear the floorboards behind me creak and figured it was my friend coming out to follow me for a cup of water or to go to the kitchen. As I walk across the living room and stop at the thermostat, the lights are still off at this point and the creaks continue, and then I hear it stop a few feet behind me near the kitchen. The kitchen lights don’t turn on and I hear nothing else. Feeling like he was waiting behind me and I was being watched, I said “what’s up dude! Need something?” I turn around and nobody is there. I’ve only ever read about this dreadful feeling of being watched.. and it is indeed every bit dreadful upon realization in person. A minute ago I swore someone followed me down. I was taken aback and my skeptical ass once again took note and spoke nothing of it. I go back upstairs.

About 30 minutes pass and it’s still cold. At this point, everyone is asleep and I decide to turn up the thermostat a couple notches, nothing crazy. I turn on the upstairs hallway light bright enough to light the steps and see from downstairs. I proceeded to head downstairs and stop once again at the thermostat. No floorboard creaks except for my own steps this time. As I am turning up the thermostat and thinking to myself how odd the creaking was the first time, a noise broke my train of thought. I hear the ball from the foosball table several feet away near the fireplace, audibly roll across its surface and hit one of the side walls. Nobody is around and I certainly am too far to touch it. I froze in fear and hastily go upstairs back to sleep, not knowing how to mentally process the increasingly evident occurrences. I eventually sleep under the pretense that nothing is definitive enough for me to be conclusively sure that this cabin is haunted. I don’t mention or wake anyone up about my experiences.

The next morning as we leave and drive back home, the balloons were brought up by my gf’s friend/couple who stayed across the hall. I took this as an opening to talk about my experiences and disclosed them. At this point, my gf’s friend goes pale, gets serious and tells us that the previous night- she was still wide awake when she noticed a dark figure standing at the foot of her bed. She states that she went into panic mode after blinking and realizing it wasn’t a dream or hallucination and shook her boyfriend awake (who I thought followed me down the stairs earlier that night), only to have it disappear. This by far, coupled with my experiences is undeniable evidence. I myself was wide-eyed upon hearing this solid piece of information. My gf’s cousin who stayed in the room next to us then mentions she heard what sounded like breathing in her room but dismissed it as naturally occurring sounds of the walls in the cabin.

These events stand-alone could be nominal and maybe explained, but collectively it’s hard to deny that something was present and amiss.

yoopdoodle,None,False,False,False,11me2k7,False,False,t3_11me2k7,I think I’m haunted. Part 2,"If you’ve read my previous post, you know that I’ve had countless paranormal experiences regardless of where I am or who’s around me. In part 1 I really only mentioned some things that occurred away from home and at my mom’s houses. But I experienced similar and also incredibly different experiences at my dad’s, and would love your opinions on this shit.

So my grandfather on my dad’s side built a house for his mother when he was in his 20s. She grew old and even died in the living room of that house. When she died, and after my dad left my mom, my dad bought it. He restored it, put in a pool, this and that. My room there was actually her old room before she died.

I was 8 when my dad bought that house, so I had plenty of paranormal occurrences prior from living with my mom in her old house.

My brother believes in ghosts, but he swears up and down that the only reason he believes, and the only time he’s experienced anything paranormal, was in my dad’s old house. He refuses, however, to tell us what happened to him while we lived there.

Now I mention my great-grandmother’s passing, but I know she’s not a ghost haunting me or that house. I didn’t even know her. That, and my spirits all feel very masculine in presence.

If one of my ghosts, however, is a poltergeist, I probably acquired it from there.

Not much happened at my dad’s old house in the grand scheme of things. I lived there (part-time obviously cuz my parents divorced when I was 5) for the longest time out of any place I’ve lived, from age 8 to 16. But the few stories I have to tell about this place are significantly scarier to me than my ghostie that I have at my mom’s. Not to mention the shit I’ve seen at my dad’s new place.

Stuff moved around. Constantly. I’d set my toothbrush on the vanity counter, just for it suddenly be thrown off. *Thrown*. I’d see shadow figures stand in my doorway so often (the same one I usually saw in my paranormal kind of sleep paralysis at my mom’s old house and recently in her apartment, but this time I was wide awake at my dad’s) that I had to start shutting my door before I went to bed. I’d hear shuffling from right outside my window, and even though I could see the moonlight coming through my closed curtains, I couldn’t see a shadow where a person making those shuffling footsteps would be.

I never had sleep paralysis there. Strange nightmares, even considering how crazy my normal nightmares were, but no sleep paralysis ever occurred in that house.

The whole energy was different in this house. I’m my mom’s old house, the atmosphere was lonely, empty. But there at my dad’s all I could feel was danger.

That was the more normal kind of ghost stuff. A couple years before my dad sold that house, the second scariest thing that’s ever happened to me in my life happened. Hell, it didn’t even happen to me, but I heard it happen to someone or something else.

I was laying in my bed one night, literally just about to fall asleep when I hear a scream across the street.

That house was on a street that ran through the middle of the woods, right? And my great-aunt lived next door to us, and across the street was an old couple who ran a very small maple syrup business. The next group of houses was much further down the street and separated by an assload of trees.

This experience I had has led me to believe in paranormal creatures before I started seeing those pale guys crawling around. Before, I only believed in ghosts.

So I heard a scream from across the street. I knew it wasn’t the old man who lived across the street, as this absolutely blood-curdling scream sounded like a younger guy. There was only one guy that age that lived on my street, and that's much further down, and passed through loads of trees. Not to mention, this guy is very much alive today, and I graduated high school with him.

So it's pretty clear that this scream came from no one I knew. And there weren't any missing people in the area, no suspicious things happening, nothing. No reason for me to hear what I did.

So I roll over and turn to my window. But this scream sounded far, like in the woods behind my old neighbor's house. And while I suppose that old couple could be murderers, I'd say it's highly unlikely as they're sweet as can be and their lights were all out.

It stopped, and thinking I might just be really tired, I roll back over onto my back. 

The screaming started again, this time much worse. If you can imagine someone torturing another person in front of you in the most horrible of ways, this is how that guy would sound. It was awful. It sounded an awful lot like when that one dude disappears in the Blair Witch Project, and you know he's dead, but the witch is impersonating his final screams as she killed him. Awful screams. It brings out this primal instinct to help.

But I had this overwhelming feeling to stay right there in bed for my safety as well. It was only a year later that I learned about skinwalkers and how they can impersonate people to draw in their victims. I think this might have been something like that. They also say that the farther away the scream is, the closer the creature is to you. Which means that that thing could've been right outside my window after I rolled back over.

I heard the scream one last time, the worst of it all, higher pitch, wordless, just moans, heavy breathing, and screeching beyond terror. Then it very suddenly stopped.

And for some reason, I stopped worrying as soon as the screaming stopped and peacefully fell asleep. I seem to sleep the best when some of the scariest shit happens to me, for some reason.

I've never asked my family if they heard something similar that night. 

At that house, I also heard my name whispered a lot, coming from right behind me. This one time I was taking out my dogs, the parents left for work and my brother was in the shower, and as I opened the door I heard someone whisper my name right behind me. Obviously no one was there. I asked my brother if he had called me just in case, but he said no. And my name isn't exactly common, so I can't really mistake ""Alayna"" for the sound the door made as I opened it.

That's the only time I've heard a disembodied voice that didn't belong to me or that man that I hear all the time.

Okay, now onto the scariest thing that's ever happened to me.

My dad was in the process of selling the house. I was 16. I was home alone and went to take the dogs out for a walk. Again, the property was big and bordered by a forest, with a tree line separating neighbors on one side of the house, and my great-aunt on the other side of the house sharing our 2-acre wide lawn. The property was about 1.5 acres deep as well, so I normally just took the three little dogs to the far treeline, then to the side treeline, and if they hadn't done their business yet I'd take them up to the front yard. I hadn't even made it all the way down to the far treeline before they'd all done their business, and if they hadn't gotten it out there I don't know what I would've done.

So I started to take them back to the house when I hear a rustling noise way over on the side treeline, about a full acre away from where I was standing with the pups (Sound traveled strangely far in my backyard, maybe because it was so open before to treelines). 

I look over at the treeline, and I swear I'm shaking when I say this cuz I've only told precious few, I see a tall, impossibly pale figure wearing what looked to be a dark grey suit and matching tophat walking very strangely into my back treeline.

Because my mind couldn't comprehend what the fuck I was seeing in broad, but late, daylight, I at first thought it was my neighbor from across the side treeline. But seeing the way it walked, looking closer at its 'skin', confirmed the worst.

When I say impossibly white I mean it was just about the color of paper. Its skin stood out *so* much against the grey of the suit. I was seeing it from the side at first, so I didn't really get a look at its face, but from what I could see it didn't really look like it had one.

It was maybe 7 feet tall, and it went back and forth from hunching and straightening up as it walked.

If you've played soccer, you'd know what 'high knees' are. Now imagine walking very slowly doing high knees, taking one knee up to your chest, then the other. All the way up. That's how this thing walked. And from what I could see, there wasn't any hair on its head. Nothing but a drab tophat. And it walked this right next to my side treeline, looking and walking toward my far treeline.

My dogs finally noticed that I was standing in the same place for a little too long, and looked over at this thing that I was seeing.

Then one of my dogs barked and I freaked the fuck out. I looked back up, expecting to see it start running at me, but I think it was much creepier that it continued to walk that same way, towards the back treeline, without looking over. All it did was slow down.

Then my other dogs got in on the barking, and I just watched as it kept slowly walking towards my treeline. Who doesn't look in the direction of a dog barking? Especially when it's really loud and echoing around the property? 

That's when I got this intense feeling of danger and grabbed all three pups and sprinted back to the house. Right when I was opening the back door, I looked back. I could barely see it still, but it was now standing still on the edge of the treeline, its legs hidden by brush but its tophat and torso clearly visible.

I locked all of the doors, windows, closed all of the curtains, turned off the lights, and cried on the couch with my dogs in my arms until my brother got home.

I told him about it and he was genuinely confused cuz didn't believe me but saw how scared I was. So he insisted it was a white-tailed deer or something and made fun of me for thinking I saw 'slenderman', even though I insisted that this thing wasn't lanky and wore a tophat. I had even called him when he was on his way there telling him to be careful and to pull into the garage rather than stop in the driveway and walk outside to the front door. 

My dad bought a new house.

I guess I mean property, cuz it was barely even built when we bought it, intending it to be a camp 30 minutes away from his old house. It had no insulation, barely running water, no floor, blah blah blah. Dad and I built it up from that, added an enclosed porch overlooking a brook, and built my room. Before we had restored it, that place always gave the creeps. It was a lot like the feeling of the previous house, *danger.* But when it was restored, I felt great.

I liked to go for walks down our driveway. Which, by the way, is a half-mile long one way, and a mile long the back way. It's really in the woods. The closest neighbors are a 7-minute drive away. So it was soothing to go for a walk down a nice dirt road, surrounded by nature. But then I started getting that bad feeling again, and I started seeing things in the trees I couldn't make out. On one walk, I could have sworn I saw the figure in the tophat, faceless and now facing me, standing deep in the woods. Several times I somewhat thought I saw it, but this time I was near convinced. So I ran back to my house, and I swear I could hear it running after me, but when I turned around at the clearing with my house, there was nothing there. But since I'm not completely convinced that I saw it, or heard the footsteps, I'm not entirely sure that it was that figure. Not to mention I was 30 minutes away from my old house.

This is when I started seeing those little pale fuckers out of the corner of my eye. I only saw them inside, and usually when it was dark. It all started at my dad's new house, but they seem to follow me everywhere.

The first time I saw one, I was going to the bathroom right before bed. It was pitch black out, and I left the door open since I was the only person sleeping downstairs and my dad and his girlfriend were passed out upstairs. Since the door was open, I was looking directly into the kitchen, where we have a big marble island in the middle of it. I saw these long, pale fingers with claws slowly reach around the corner of the island, but only if I looked over there out of the corner of my eye. I have very strange peripheral vision and can see very clearly using it, so I could see those fingers very clearly. So then I started straight at the island, hoping not to see the fingers again, but eventually, even though now I was looking straight at it and not using my peripheral vision, saw a face emerge from around the corner close to the floor.

It looked eerily like a drawing I made as a kid, but I don't remember seeing this thing prior to this moment.

It was white, much like the tophat dude, but with dark splotches all over it. It had dark, sunken holes for eyes, that I'm not exactly sure if it had eyes at all. And for a mouth, much like this drawing I had made, it didn't have a mouth *hole*, but a thin line of crusted and dripping goo in the form of a grin along its face. No hair.

Yea imagine seeing that shit in the dark. Unpleasant.

But then it just sort of faded out of existence as I was looking at it. It didn't suddenly disappear, but slowly faded away from my sight. So I got the fuck out and laid in bed terrified it would come back. I couldn't see it in my room, though, I never have. Not there, at least. 

And then almost every night after that, I saw the same thing. Sometimes it crawled really fast past the bathroom doorway. I could see it move so clearly in the corner of my eye. It wasn't built like a human. I walked on all fours, but instead of an arched back like a human would have, its back was flat and its legs were long and skinny and built like a fucked up dog. Except for the arms, which were short with those long, clawed fingernails. 

And I still see this thing. I've gotten so used to seeing it, I'm not even scared anymore just weirded out and wondering if I'm crazy. A couple days ago, here at my mom's apartment, I saw it on the floor beside my bed, but then when I turned to look at it more, it scampered away. But it sounded like something was clawing at my rug all night long. Kinda like a cat. Both of my cats are dead, and they'd never play with a rug. So this weird thing was playing at the foot of my bed with my rug.

So yea, I think I'm haunted. 

Even though the poltergeist activity only happened at my dad's old house, I've seen one thing move in my room here at my mom's one time. I had my slippers at the end of my dresser. One night, I walked into my room and one of my slippers had somehow gotten slurped up underneath my dresser. So I pull it out from under, wipe it off, and go to leave my room again when I hear it slide once more. This was recent, and since I'm so fucking used to ghosts, this only annoyed me rather than scare me. Like come on, my slippers? Do better. But I turned around and sure enough the same slipper was completely underneath my dresser again. It's never happened since. Nothing has moved around me since. But I'm curious that the spirit from my dad's which did feel malevolent, followed me here after all these years. But why?

And even more creepily, although I'm the happiest I've ever been right now, the haunting seems to be the worst. Only the feeling of the ghosts' presence isn't scary anymore. It's almost relaxing to know they're there, and I don't why it suddenly changed. But the weird thing is that I'm constantly waking up with scratch marks. On my wrists, arms, hands. Scratches that range from the size of my thumb to the size of my fingernail. I sleep with my arms tucked into my chest and I have long fingernails, but this has never happened before. If anyone knows what this means, I'd really appreciate some help. I could just be paranoid. After writing this, I'm a little nervous to deal with my ghostie and everything else I've experienced. I have a tiny scratch at the base of my thumb right now, actually.

Again, I'd love to know what people think about all this and if anyone has seen similar things. I really hope I'm not alone here.",14,9.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11me2k7/i_think_im_haunted_part_2/,False,2023-03-09 00:59:06,False,False,False,0.78,,,,
Thequestionablemoon,None,False,False,False,11n5i4f,False,False,t3_11n5i4f,Imaginary Friend Ghost,"When my cousin's son was little, he was super attached to his imaginary friend named Joseph. He would take Joseph everywhere and do things like demand that his parents buckle him into the car. So he was definitely more attached than most kids but some kids just have really realistic imaginary friends so they didn't think it was anything weird. 

Fast forward several years. My cousins have moved out of that house and their son is a lot older. One day, the dad runs into the family who had bought the house from them who has a little boy of their own. As the conversation goes on, it gets brought up that the little boy who lives in the house now has an imaginary friend he is super attached to named Joe. Obviously my cousin tells the family about his son who had his imaginary friend named Joseph while living in the same house. It's interesting, but they ultimately assume it's just a funny coincidence.

   Fast forward again to the present day. The last family moved out of the house and for several years it sat vacant. Recently, someone bought the house and renovated it. One day, my cousin ran into the guy who was renovating it (they live in a small town, it's not weird that he keeps seeing the people who bought his old house.) They were talking about the house, and my cousin mentioned the funny coincidence about the two boys having an imaginary friend with a similar name. At the point, the guy doing the renovations tells my cousin that while they were taking out a wall in the house, they found an old journal that had the name ""Joseph"" written on either the cover or first page.

When either of us would get up to see what the fuss was about she'd be standing or sitting at any of the 3 sides of her crib looking up.

One day I was holding her and walking from each framed photo of family members. I'd point to those in the pics and say, ""Who's that?""

I pointed to her mom, myself, my mom, my mil, my sil, my brother, his wife. Each time she'd say her word for that person.

There was a collage with a number of people, memories of the past my wife and I made and framed. There were family and friends who were no longer with us/passed on, including my father who'd passed away a decade before our daughter was born. I started pointing at people and if she didn't know them she'd look at me real fast and hold the palms of her hands up like ""I don't know.""

So I'd point to the person again and say their name. She'd do her best to repeat it.

In the collage was a pic of my late father and I. I pointed to me. She said Da-da! I pointed to my father and she got all excited. She started bending her knees in my arms raising up and down giggling with the biggest smile. She raised her arms up in the air and looked at the ceiling and said loudly, ""Papa! Papa! Papa-Papa-Papa-Papa!"" She kept giggling and saying ""Papa!""

I had chills and my wife was looking at us with wide eyes. I started to tear up. For one, no one had ever shown her a photo of my father. We didn't have one hanging up in the rooms where she frequented. No reason. We just didn't have very many big photos of him.  For two, she'd never said the word before. Not ever. Lastly, my brother lives halfway across the country and at that time he had only seen my daughter once. He has one daughter, but she was in college when we visited him so she'd never met our daughter. But.. My niece spent a lot of her early life around my late father before my brother relocated. ""Papa"" was what my niece called my father and he loved being called Papa.

My mother had a stroke in 2009. She spent her last months in a care home, and was hospitalised from there a few times. I lived about ten miles away. One night, I was in bed (awake, having only recently settled) and I suddenly heard my name called. It was loud, clear and sharp. Exactly the way my mother would address me when she was irritable. It freaked me out so much that I told my husband about it.

The next morning we had a call from her care home. My mother (who was suffering from vascular dementia and was non-verbal by this time) had been taken to hospital in the night. Best we could work out, the time I (thought I) heard my name was about the time they were calling an ambulance.

Went to the hospital. Mother was alive, but unable to communicate, and was fading fast. She died about 12 hours later (sadly, I was not there).

While this is not the most dramatic story, it is 100% true, and something that I, as a bit of a sceptic, have never been able to explain. Nothing like it before or since. No history of imagining stuff. No prior knowledge that my mother had been taken unwell that night.

To this day, I swear she called my name (more in annoyance than anything else!), and I have no explanation for it. None.

I was around 10ish at the time, at home, and a friend from school, her younger brother, and their parents were over, visiting. 

Us three kids decided to play hide and seek in the house since we were bored. We played a few rounds and it came to be my turn to be “it.” Since we were playing in the house and there weren’t many places to hide, we decided to make it harder and turn off all the lights in the hallway and rooms and close all the blinds. It’s late afternoon during the time of year it gets dark early so it was super dark in the rooms. I go about looking for them and I decide to try the closet in my room. 

My closet is like in the wall, with two swinging doors to access. My clothes are hanging in there, and some junk on the floor of the closet. It would’ve been hard for someone to hide in there but maybe not impossible. Anyways, I decide to check the closet. I reach my hand in and feel around. I end up touching what I felt as someone’s open palm. Like the back of their hand was against the back of the closet. I touch the hand and immediately feel it flinch and pull away. As it pulls away I feel their fingers as well. At that point I feel like I caught the first person and announce, “ok I felt you! Get out!”

But then no one steps out. I say again in the dark, “cmon I felt you, you lose come on out.”

Again, silence. 

Then I hear my friend and her brother come into the room and ask what’s wrong? Now I’m confused, I turn on the light and look I’m through the closet but there’s no one there, just my clothes and stuff. I explain what I felt and all three of us end up feeling really freaked out. We stop playing after that and go to our parents to explain what happened. 

Our parents go and check but there’s nothing there. They don’t make anything more out of it. 

Idk what it was that I touched but I SWEAR to you, I remember it like it was yesterday, I felt a palm and fingers and felt it pull away. Skin feels recognizable. And for it to flinch and pull away felt even MORE obvious. I never had another paranormal event after that so that’s why I figured it was nothing but that was the first time I felt genuine terror for ghosts or the paranormal.",10,50.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11n2aa6/scary_event_during_hide_and_seek/,False,2023-03-09 20:08:38,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

BunyipBlight,None,False,False,False,11mobxo,False,False,t3_11mobxo,could I have really seen the ghost of my deceased cat?,"As a devoted pet owner, the passing of one of beloved furry friends was a devastating experience. The grief and sense of loss can linger long after their physical presence is gone. However, what happens when you believe you have seen the ghost of your deceased cat? That's exactly what happened to me last night. I was getting ready for bed when I caught a glimpse of movement out of the corner of my eye. Turning around, I saw a familiar silhouette, that of my late cat, staring at me with his big round eyes. At first, I thought it was my imagination playing tricks on me, but the more I looked, the more certain I became that it was indeed my cat's ghost. I was feeling a mix of emotions - fear, shock, and awe - as I tried to make sense of what I was witnessing.

The encounter left me feeling both unsettled and strangely comforted. On the one hand, it was a startling sighting that challenged my beliefs and understanding of the world - I have always considered myself a skeptical person. On the other hand, seeing my cat's ghost offered me a glimmer of hope that his spirit lives on and that he is watching over me, purring from above (?).

piperpeep,None,False,False,False,11n7soq,False,False,t3_11n7soq,4th Man Experience/Guardian Angel?,"I'm interested to hear from people who have experienced something like this, or have knowledge of these things.

I'm 55 (f) now and I had this experience 50 years ago.  I remember it clearly.  

My mother made me go with while she went dress shopping for herself at the mall.  I didn't want to go, I would have rather stayed at home to play with my friends.  Back then we played outside all day and came home when the streetlights came on.  But, I had to go because no one else was home to watch me. (I am the youngest of 6 kids).  

We got to the mall and when I saw the huge central fountain, I begged my mom to let me stay in the court and play by the fountain.  This was before the internet, before people worried too much about serial killers and pedophiles, I was never taught about stranger danger.  My mom wasn't worried about it either, and after I promised to stay by the fountain, she went into the dress store.  

I remember playing for awhile, dipping my fingers in the water, walking  around the entire fountain, and listening to the sound of the water.  I don't know why l, but suddenly I looked up and saw a man probably in his 30s with dark hair and black framed glasses in a white shirt and jeans, brown jacket.  He was about 30 feet away walking in my direction.

As soon as I saw this man, I heard a male voice say, ""Go find your mother."" It wasn't the man in the glasses, his mouth stayed closed.  This voice came from right next to me, but there was no one there.  While I pondered what this meant and who might be speaking to me, the man in the glasses got closer.  The same voice spoke again, ""The man in the glasses wants to take a little girl in glasses. Go find your mother, NOW!"". 

  The word ""now"" was yelled in my ear.  So, even though I didn't understand (and still don't understand) what was happening, I got up from the edge of the fountain where I was sitting and started walking toward the store where my mother was shopping.  The man was about 10 feet away now.  Now the man in glasses spoke.  He smiled a creepy smile that scared me, chuckled and said, ""Ah you knew what I was going to do, eh?"" Then the disturbing chuckle again. This made me run into the store where I found my mom and grabbed her hand.  She was surprised to see me.  I was silent for the rest of the shopping trip.

I didn't tell anyone about this until a few years ago.  I told my mom.  She thought it was Good.  I told my atheist sceptical husband, he thought I was hallucinating.  Personally, I have no clue.  I don't  know why this happened to me, why would I be warned and saved from that man and possibly another kid taken?  

The articles I have read about  4th man experiences all have an element of extreme physical distress, like people climbing Mt Everest, or trekking across Antarctica.  This was not the case for me.

Dad is my hero - he was the Daddest of all Dads. I got through the intense grieving period pretty okay, but I still have some pretty icky moments where I suddenly remember he's gone and I have a wee breakdown.

I was having one such breakdown tonight - particularly bad. I was begging Dad to show me he was still around and crying like a giant baby. Two things in a row happened that may seem pretty whatever to others but was significant for me:
My friend sent me a snap of his new cat, which he named Dave - My Dad's name.
Then immediately after this, one of my monitors woke up even though I was  I am 100% certain I shut down my computer because I always do, and up popped my companies screen saver with their slogan - ""We're One""
I was immediately overwhelmed by this sense of total peace and comfort. Warm like I had been wrapped in an invisible hug.

I just wanted to share one of my experiences with my Dad to hopefully bring a little comfort to someone who has lost someone they love dearly - they are with you. Speak to them like you would if they were there in the flesh and you'll pick up on little things they do to show they're listening, and they love you in death just as much as they did in life.

robkat22,None,False,False,False,11nbuvz,False,False,t3_11nbuvz,My grandmother’s missing necklace appeared in my bedroom days after she passed.,"My grandmother was diagnosed with lung cancer about 10 years ago. I was absolutely devastated as she was my favourite person on earth. She lived 3 hours away from me so I only saw her once before she died (diagnosis to her passing was quick). 

Before I saw her for the last time, I decided to get rid of an old clunky jewelry box where I kept all my necklaces (which I never wear) and bought a jewelry tree instead. I went through all my pieces of jewelry and discarded stuff I didn’t want and organized the remaining pieces on the tree.

During my last visit with her I asked her where her necklace was. I was curious because she always wore it when I was a kid but I hadn’t seen it in years (please know I wasn’t asking because I wanted it. I was just reminiscing. Not really my style anyway). She had me look all over the house in various rooms and boxes and drawers. I couldn’t find it. My aunt thought she may have given it to her niece and forgotten about it. 

Flash forward to the day of her funeral. I was getting ready in the bathroom and decided that maybe I would wear a necklace (which, again, I rarely do). I went to my jewelry tree and sitting right there on one of the branches was the necklace. It wasn’t even buried behind everything. It was right in front. I started welling up immediately and asked my husband if he had put it there. He looked at me dumbfounded and said no. I hadn’t even told him about the necklace or the conversation I had with my grandmother a few weeks prior so I believe him. To this day, I have no idea how it ended up with my jewelry. I wore it to the funeral that day but haven’t worn it since. I still have it. My aunt and dad can’t explain it either. Neither were at my house in the days between and neither would pull a stunt like that. 

If I hadn’t just cleaned out my jewelry box I would have thought that perhaps she gave it to me a long time before and I had forgotten.

It happened to my son when he was 4.
One day he told me that he had seen a ghost in his room. At first I was really worried, I believed him straight away,as I have had my own paranormal encounters. Some good, most very bad.

So I asked my son "" really?, What did it do?
He answered with "" nothing, he just looked at me and smiled ""
I asked him if he said anything to you, and how did it make you feel?

My son then said, he smiled and made me feel good. He was a nice ghost.
So I then started thinking it was my grandad, who passed away when I was 20 and he never meet my son.

I asked my son what he looked like, he told me that he looked nice and was wearing all white. 
A week later I subtly put a photo of my grandad on the fridge and didn't let my son know about it. When he noticed the photo, he was yelling at me so excited saying "" mum, that's the nice ghost"" and just kept repeating it.

My grandad was also buried in a completely white suit.

I cried when my son said this, because I would always say to him, I wish you could've met my grandad. He would have loved you so much.

Hotsauce62,None,False,False,False,11mukmr,False,False,t3_11mukmr,"It's just a nightmare, right?","I think I'll post this here just to see what others think of this experience. I'll try to keep it brief but thorough. Around two years ago  now I was working in landscaping, which means I woke up at 5 am and was at work by 6am. Sometimes my now fiance would spend the night with me for no particular reason other than to spend the night. One morning, I woke up and got ready for work and left for work. Everything seemed normal, just another early morning. Around 1 p.m., I got a call from my fiance asking where I was. I was really confused but told her I'm at work like always. She questions me and asked if I had gone in late or something, to which I told her nope left just like always. She then tells me that she vividly remembered me coming up to the bed and crawling in with her, saying I wasn't feeling good and that I was going to take the day off. She questioned me, and I put my arm around her, and we both drifted off to sleep. That did not happen, and I chalked it up to her having a vivid dream. About 2 and a half months later the same circumstances I get another frantic call at around 7am. My fiance is not a morning person and will usually sleep till noon if she has the day off so I was immediately wondering what happened. She tells me that it happened again, only this time when I went to get in bed with her she said your not Hotsauce. (I don't want to give out my real name hope y'all understand) to which whatever was posing as me gets angry and says how did you know. This freaked her out and she said she suddenly felt like she was in danger, so she finally sat up and looked towards where the voice came from and realized nothing was there. I eventually managed to calm her down and was convinced she just had a bad nightmare or something. We talk later that night and she says that whatever it was felt dangerous. I am a believer in the paranormal, but had lived in this particular apartment for about 2 years at that point and had never experienced anything. The next day she decided to stay the night again since I didn't have to work and she felt safer sleeping with me that night due to the pervious morning. I agreed and we went to bed like normal. That night around 3am I had woken up to use the bathroom. Still half asleep I do my thing and suddenly the curtain to the shower flys open. I'm not talking about moving a little either. I mean it was completely closed and suddenly it was pushed all the way to the other side showing the shower to me. I am immediately awake and aware now and jump out of the bathroom. I stand there for a few seconds almost waiting for something else to happen, but nothing ever did. I didn't go back to sleep that night and told my fiance about what happened when she woke up. A few other small things happened after this too, but I'll end this here to see what y'all think of this. I'm honestly still confused about it to this day and never really understood what was going on for the rest of the time I lived in that room.

When I saw the house I immediately knew we would get it, I saw all of us living there and being happy but I felt a strong attachment and sadness to the home.

We snuck into the backyard and I can tell from landscaping that someone older had lived there maybe in their 60’s which is considered mid life to me.

We won the house at auction an paid for it. We did digging the wife passed away and then the husband passed away a year or two later. The husband passed in the actual house. They were from out of state so no one knew for a while according to a neighbor.

I now own everything these people had and have to go through everything. I am so sad an it breaks my heart that man passed alone. The neighbors said they were very good people. I can find throughout my Google searches the man volunteered at a soup kitchen.

victim80,None,False,False,False,11mn1f0,False,False,t3_11mn1f0,slowly increasing paranormal activity.,"For the past six months I've suspected that I was sharing a room with a ghost.

At first I chalked it up to my imagination.

Then the shadow person sightings started. My bedroom has a bathroom. I keep the door closed to it because there is a light in the restroom that comes on at night. It's dim unless your night eyes are active.

It was cold in the bathroom one night so I had the door open so the heat in my bedroom would warm it up, I'm reading a  book when I that I saw movement in the corner of my eye.
The light on my nightstand was on so the light in the bathroom wasn't active, so I chalked it up to the light flickering.

A week later, it's another cold night and I have the bathroom door open, all the lights are out so the dim light inside the bathroom is on.

The only other light source is my tablet. I spot something dark move at the very edge of the bathroom doorframe and then the normal bathroom light flicks on for a second.
The normal light is linked to a sort of fan that buzzes loudly in the ceiling.
I hear it pop on for the very short moment the light flickers.

Now things are being moved around my room.  I've woke up from a deep sleep to find the bathroom door open.
The mini fridge open, or the microwave door open.

I've felt watched on one occasion.

Occasionally when I do use the restroom I'll notice the shower curtain is closed, even though I only close it while taking a shower.
When I'm not using the shower the curtain stays open.

It hasn't shown any hostility to me, it seems to just want me to know it's there.

MouseKing69,None,False,False,False,11ncrko,False,False,t3_11ncrko,I was woken up to a small creature,"So I’ve told my friends and family this story and they just look at me like I’m crazy. I ended up telling my wife when we were moving out of the house that this happened in. 

I lived in Nevada with my wife in a newly constructed house that was three floors. The master bedroom was on the third floor and there was no door up to the master floor it was just open. Like a loft, but it was a full sized area not a converted attic or anything. This is pretty common in NV so that they can squeeze as many thin taller houses in a lot as possible. 

Anyway, one night about a month into moving into the house we’re both asleep. I wake up in the middle of the night around 2-4ish and see all the way at the other side of the room a little creature. All black. I couldn’t make out any features or eyes or anything but it was small. Maybe two feet tall and had two arms and legs like a person but was wider and didn’t move like a person. It was unnaturally fast. It ran quickly to the edge of the bed and then I could tell it was looking right at me. I could move and I very consciously remember thinking “ugh I do not have time for this”. I remember it peered over the mattress and had a longer nose. But for some reason it was not able or allowed to get on the bed. I watched it for about 10 seconds then was like ok if it can’t get up I’m just going to roll over. So I rolled over and nothing else happened that night. 

Pretty anticlimactic story I know. But that’s what happened to me that night. I never saw anything in that house again expect for that one night. I was definitely awake and I could move though so it was not sleep paralysis. I’ve had that once and that is much worse and terrifying.

One time my mom for the life of her could not find her bracelet. She takes it off every night and leaves it on her nightstand. She searched and searched for days with no avail. A few mornings later the bracelet showed up right infront of the coffee pot. My mom is an avid coffee drinker. At least 2 every morning & even at night. There’s no way she missed it! 

Another time, my asthma inhaler went missing. I used it the night before and put it in my sock drawer right next to my bed. (This top drawer is reachable & holds snacks & other things I may want in the night 😂). I got up the next morning and went to work. At this time in my life I was dealing with severe asthma that I never had an ounce of in the past. I called my mom from work (she’s always been a stay at home mom) and asked her if she could bring my inhaler to work for me because I forgot it and I couldn’t breathe. Mind you I had just filled the Rx the day before

She looks where I tell her to look. She calls back says it’s not there. I tell her “yes it is. I just used it before bed.” She looks again & searches the house, nothing. Mind you my mother finds EVERYTHING. She always sees things I “can’t find”. She calls me back again saying it’s nowhere you must have it. I look again, I don’t have it. I call the pharmacy. Now, I happened to know a girl who works there. She went to school with my sister & recognizes my voice. She tells me since I literally just picked one up yesterday insurance isn’t gonna cover it, but send your mom down to pick it up & I’ll ring it through the register next week & have you pay for it then- once insurance will cover it again. My mother picks it up, brings it to me at work. 

At this particular time my grandmother was visiting from Florida & she had dinner over my house with my parents. I stroll in from work at about 9pm. I walk into the kitchen where my mom had just cleared away all the dishes from dinner. I go to pull out a chair at the table & I go “seriously mom….” My inhaler was in the middle of the kitchen table.

AzmodeusDesires,None,False,False,False,11nn495,False,False,t3_11nn495,I've been dreaming of the same man.,"So I say I attract spirits because I have always had experiences ever since I was little(4 or 5). I'm 21 now and I still have experiences on a daily basis but I seem to dream of the same man. I think he's haunting me.

My first experience of him was in college. I had a dream I was in a russian hotel and I saw him staring at me. He was grinning. He had grey skin, black and white striped prison clothes, long cut across his neck and little bits of black hair. The scariest part was I remember his eyes. Completely lifeless and staring right into my soul. Since that day I've had random moments of server anxiety, frozen with fear and constant nightmares about him.

As time went on more things started to happen. I got a scratch on my back, three long scratches on my wall, handprints on my wall. The creepiest thing of all. Most nights for 3 minutes straight I'll hear 3 knocks on my window in a rhythmic pattern. I know when he's around because I feel his anger and see his face staring at me. Grinning.

I'm using as much protection as I know. Cleansing, crystals, spell jars. I cleanse my room regularly. If any of you have anymore advice it would be very helpful thank you :)",5,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11nn495/ive_been_dreaming_of_the_same_man/,False,2023-03-10 11:55:01,False,False,False,0.9,,,,
wernerverklempt,None,False,False,True,11nlen0,False,False,t3_11nlen0,Haunted House in Ventura,"There is a house in downtown Ventura that is reportedly very haunted. 

It’s a huge old house. My sister met a woman who used to live there. It has seven bedrooms spread over 4 levels. I’m not sure what the architected type is called, so I’ll just describe it as an old wood frame house with an antique ornate style, picturesque, set on the foothill overlooking downtown and the ocean and the Channel Islands.

When I lived in the area the house was vacant. During my frequent late-night walks, I’d sometimes sneak up the two dozen front stairs and peer in the windows or walk around back. Occasionally I’d bring a date up there to fool around on the porch swing. It was vacant for a long time. 

My sister told me the house was haunted, and once when she was visiting the house, a floor lamp suddenly slid across the living room, apparently of its own volition. Startled, she looked at her friend, the woman who lived there, and she kind of shrugged and said that things like that occurred frequently. 

They would often hear noises from the upper floor. There was another tenant who resided up there, and sometimes they would hear noises, like someone talking or walking around, only to find out later that the tenant was not at home. 

She eventually moved out, and sometime later I met her and I asked her about the house. She confirmed the lamp story and said that many things happened there and that she moved out because of them. She had hated living there. She said, “Let me show you something…”.

She pulled out her phone and flipped to a photograph of a young man sitting on a sofa in front of a dark picture window or maybe glass sliding doors. She said that it was her son on the couch. The photo was just kind of a typical random snapshot of a kid sitting on a couch. Also in the photo was a large swirl of white smoke to the right of the kid. It looked like cigarette smoke that had drifted in front of the lens, except when I looked closer I was startled and frightened by what I noticed about it

There was a very clearly defined face in the smoke. Not a human face, but one of a creature with an elongated muzzle and head shape like a canine. The mouth was open showing large, sharp, pointy teeth. The eyes were fierce and appeared to be looking into the camera. I truly hate to say this, because I tend to roll my eyes at stories like this, but it is best described as a dragon or demon-face. 

I don’t believe in demons. The image was unmistakable and gave me chills and goosebumps. The woman said that she hadn’t seen anything when she took the photo, that it was just a casual snapshot of her son while they were sitting and watching television.

She managed to get the landlord to reluctantly let her out of the lease after she told him everything that happened there. Eventually they found tenants. There were old cars and beat-up motorcycles out front, and junk stored on the porches and balconies, so they didn’t appear to be neat, clean, orderly tenants and the house looked in need of repairs and maintenance. I never met the new residents, but I wonder if they had any experiences in that creepy old house.",2,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11nlen0/haunted_house_in_ventura/,False,2023-03-10 10:25:43,False,False,False,1.0,,,,

We chilled out and played video games for most of the day but when it got late we decided to go to sleep. When i was younger I never closed the door because I was scared something would happen and if i screamed my parents wouldn’t hear me. We both fell asleep in my bed I was about two or three feet away from him in bed. I woke up in the middle of the night and heard something outside my door. I decided to sit up and look out my door, what I saw still gives me chills to this day. I saw what looked like a demonic version of my grandmother on her hands and knees outside my door. It noticed me and looked me in my eyes and its eyes looked demonic. It had long hair down to its chest.i immediately layer back down and tried to wake my friend up but he wouldn’t wake up. I sat up and it was gone. I didn’t look around the room to see if it came in I just laid back down and closed my eyes and prayed It was gone until I fell asleep. The next morning I told my grandmother what i saw and she said it may have been her bc she dropped her glasses. the only reason I don’t believe that is because she had short hair (down to her neck) and it had hair to its chest and different eyes and it wasn’t wearing the same clothes as her and the time she said she dropped her glasses just didnt seem like the same time I woke up. I still get chills when I think back to that day… this makes me believe we all have a demonic version of ourselves (a demon that looks just like us).

gilleykelsey,None,False,False,False,11nyajx,False,False,t3_11nyajx,Texas Demon House?,"Okay guys I lived in this house for about 7 years and I have a LOT of stories from it so sorry if this is long. I have ADHD so I tend to ramble but I’m gonna keep it chronological and as structured as I can. Let me know if you want a part 2!

Some background info: This is in a small town in central Texas. The house is a one story, 3 BR, 2 Bath with a front and back living room a nice sized back yard with a palm tree, gazebo, and a shed converted into a “bar”. It was right across the street from a Catholic Church/ cemetery and after we moved out we found out the property used to be an orphanage in the 1960s that shut down because before that it was a funeral home with a crematorium that the orphanage was using to dispose of the bodies of the malnourished/ abused children living there. We (me and my immediate family) were initially hired to clean up the house after the previous tenants trashed it. By trashed I mean TRASHED! The carpet when we cleaned it was a light beige color but it started out black. There were human sized holes in the walls as if someone was slammed repeatedly all through the house. Dead chickens and other small animals were all over the floor along w black candles, pentagrams on the walls and floor and some mystery blood smeared on the back closet of the master bedroom. How’d we feel comfortable enough moving in after all we found? Well when it was cleaned up it was a really nice place and the rent was only $450 a month (we should’ve known just based off the low rent).

First Incident:
It was our first day in the house. I had most of my stuff in already so my parents told me to wait at the new house while they went to our old house with my siblings to get more stuff. I decided to take a nap after putting a few things on my dresser. In the center of the dresser I put a Mary candle my mom had given me. Might be important to note that the most Satanic stuff was found in the master bedroom that had a walk in closet, dressing room, and its own bathroom. This room became my room because everyone else were too scared to even set foot in it including my parents. The whole 7 years we lived there the only time anyone else but me set foot in the room was before we moved in while we were cleaning the house. My little brother got the middle bedroom and my little sister got the room next to his at the end of the hall next to the other bathroom and my parents opted to turn the back living room into their bedroom. After arranging my stuff on the dresser I laid on my bed to take a nap while waiting for my family to return with more stuff. Not 2 minutes after I shut my eyes the candle slid off the right side of the dresser to the floor with a thud. I was a little freaked out but as I was by myself I tried not to so I tried rationalizing it saying it was the wind or my dresser is crooked/ slanted. I checked the dresser by pulling it away from the wall a smidge and putting a ball in the center to see if it rolled and it didn’t. Then I checked all the doors and windows to make sure there wasn’t a draft or something. I put the candle back in the center and laid back down. Not a minute or so after I shut my eyes the candle slid off the left side this time like someone was sliding it and fell. I said “NOPE!” And ran outside and waited on the porch til my family got back. When they questioned why I was outside because it was summer and Texas is hellishly hot in summer I replied that I wanted some fresh air and sun trying to play it off so they wouldn’t think I was crazy.

2nd Incident: This was after we had been living there a few months. I was asleep in my room with the door open because it made me feel better and the rest of my immediate family were gathered in my sister’s room down the hall telling each other ghost stories as it was close to Halloween. My mom said something along the lines of “Y’all better stop telling that stuff before something happens” Right after she said that my door slammed shut and I started screaming. (Side note: when I was younger I used to sleep talk/ walk a LOT especially if there was paranormal activity in the house as this wasn’t the last time we lived in a haunted house unfortunately) My mom urged my step dad to go check on me but he just said “You go f-king check on her” so eventually they both came to check on me. They said once they opened the door they saw me sitting up in bed with my eyes open but glassy and not focused on anything. I kept saying “Get off me get off me help”. They were too scared to enter the room so from the door they switched on the light and said “GET OUT”. At that moment they said a black cloud lifted off me and I fell back in bed with my eyes closed fast asleep. Then they FREAKING LEFT ME THERE BECAUSE THEY WERE TOO SCARED and told me about it in the morning. I knew they weren’t lying because the dream I had the night before matched up with what they were saying and they both looked kinda pale when they were telling me. Scaredy-cat jerks leaving me in there 😂

In January of 2013, my uncle sadly passed away from cancer in one of the bedrooms of my grandparent’s home. Up until around 2012 when my uncle got sick and started living with my grandparents, I stayed at their house almost every weekend to just hang out with them.

My another brother; he went to my brother's room because he had cables to watch a movie. He tells after finish watching he unplugged the TV and left the room. As soon as he left he would hear the TV playing. 

My sister; she said once she saw the wood block being dragged by itself (I never saw it begin dragged by itself but I would hear it being dragged)

Large-Baker-8,None,False,False,False,11nn1km,False,False,t3_11nn1km,The Cursed Mansion Across the Road,"This experience happend a while back but i thought i might as well share it on here for you guys to read. So back in the mid 2000's I lived in this house with my dad, my mum and my sister. Across the road from this house was this massive mansion which had a lot of residential turnover which my family, me included, believes is cursed. My sister and I were kind of scared of it anyways because it was this big dark house that felt uninviting and cold. When my family moved in to our house there was a wealthy business man living in the mansion across the road who moved in a few months before us. This guy was really rich, luxury cars, massive dinner parties with his rich friends, etc. He owned a bunch of business' started a new business shortly after we moved in and after almost 6 months of starting this business he went bankrupt. He lost every, he sold all of his luxury cars, he had no more dinner parties and he quickly became an alcoholic. He ended up selling his house because he of course couldn't afford it. 

After he sold the house a young recently married couple moved in. I have no idea how they afforded the house but non the less they moved in and settled in quickly. My parents actually become quite good friends with them and we would have them over for dinner occasionally. They stayed in the house for about two years but within that two years they'd had 3 miscarriages. The wife ended up becoming depressed and even had to be committed to a psych ward because she was thinking about ending her own life. 

These two incidents could be just classified as bad luck or unfortunate events but the third one in my opinion solidify's this house as being cursed. So another couple moved into the house after the other couple decided to move and this couple were pretty wealthy. They hired a maid to stay in the house to assist them with cooking and cleaning etc. After a year of them living there we once again got pretty close to this couple and would sometimes have dinner with them and swim in the pool that they had. One night my dad woke up and had a strange feeling. He heard something outside so looked out the his bedroom window and saw the maid packing her car in the middle of the night. The couple that was living there was away for the weekend and the maid was staying at the house. He thought it was weird and was a bit concerned but didn't think much of it and went back to sleep. After he went back to sleep he had a dream that the maid ended up ending her own life in the garage of the house. 

He woke up in the morning a bit shaken from his dream and had a sort of sixth sense feeling. He decided to go over there and check if everything was okay. He rung the doorbell but didn't get an answer. He deiced to go around the back of the house to see if the backdoor was unlocked. The backdoor was unlocked so he went in. He entered the living room and saw the maid hanging from the chandelier. He instantly rand home and called  the police and ambulance but by that point it was too late. I remember seeing my dad after the event and he was as white as a ghost. Of course he didn't tell us what had happened as we were only young. He ended up telling us when I was about 15-16. I don't bring it up to him because he hates talking about it and gets really upset about the whole thing. We moved a little while after the last event happened. I still have no idea what happened to the next family that moved in but I seriously hope that nothing bad happened to them. I know this story is kinda hard to believe and whenever I tell people about they sometimes don't believe me but I can whole hearty swear that this happened. To this day I am convinced that the mansion was cursed.",1,10.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11nn1km/the_cursed_mansion_across_the_road/,False,2023-03-10 11:51:22,False,False,False,0.78,,,,

It seems every thrift store I go in has one spot, that if you walk over it, or stand there you get instantly light-headed and dizzy, like the floor is about to drop out. But if you step away from that spot the feeling immediately goes away.

I used to think it was just me, but the last time I was shopping with my best friend and it happened I called her over like I wanted to show her something and had her stand where I had been. She got a weird look on her face like she wasn't feeling well and I asked if she felt dizzy or light-headed. She said yes and commented that maybe she needed to eat. I had her move off the spot and she felt better. That's when I told her my theory.

I have felt this sensation in other places but I think it's common in thrift stores because there are so many old items that come and go, one of them is bound to have destructive energy that either tore a hole in the veil between our world and the next or a hole between dimensions, depending on what you believe.

So I live in India and on March 7 it was ""Holi"" the festival of colours, where you throw colours at each other and have fun with your friends and family.

But mind you the days around this festival are also the dark ones, these days are very much preferable for black magic and dark spiritual activities.
It is the time where all these activities are said to be at their peak. People do all sort of horrifying rituals to harm others.

What happened that day was, at night I woke up from my sleep feeling nauseous and ran towards the bathroom where the sink was. I had a sudden sharp pain in my head and I held my head. I was hanging on the sink, waiting to throw up.

As I was there, I heard someone calling my name. I ignored it thinking it was just my younger brother messing with me.
But again in the same monotone the voice came back. It called my name (not the nickname, but my official one) which is unusual for anyone to call me like this.

I peaked my head outside the bathroom door to look for someone and I saw a dark shadow  which was darker than the room itself was. It was tall and like floating at its place.
It was tall around 10 feet. I just stood there thinking maybe it's the curtain on the window that's moving like it.
But then, that shadow thing started to walk towards me. I slammed the bathroom door closed and yelled ""mom"". My parents ran as fast as they could to reach me and then I opened the door, they held me close. I was quivering, not just scared but very confused and curious. What was it? I've never encountered anything like this ever before. I don't even consider myself sensitive to these entities. 

Mind you I don't have any mental health issues that can possibly cause this. I wasn't even stressed or worried about anything.

I’m the one who discovered her and it literally happened so sudden and it was very unexpected as I had just spoke to her and saw her alive 30-40 minutes before. 
Before I even went into her room as I had closed her door not that long ago I grabbed the doorknob and just had a weird feeling. I don’t know how to explain it but it was like I knew already. I saw and I wanted to panic and run away but it’s like I kicked into x games mode and did what I had to do while crying and feeling a mess I had the power to stay somewhat calm. It’s like my mom gave me the strength. It was just a weird feeling. Had it been my other siblings they would have freaked out. I feel as if my mom left the way she left for a reason and I think wanted me to be the one as I was the closest to her and she probably knew I’d be able to handle this. There were signs as if my mom knew this day was coming and my cat was also a acting weird. As for me I had that feeling for a few days before aswell. It’s like everything that happened before was making sense now. A lot of little things. 
Anyways on Wednesday I went to the funeral home and before I went in I see an Access van passing by like it was passing in front.

when i was in 3rd grade i had a friend named rebecca, she had transferred to my school because she moved around alot from foster home to foster home. so, i didn’t plan on creating a tight bond with her because i knew she would’ve had to move eventually. 

throughout the school year she was my only friend, she was somebody who truly understood me. i never felt understood until i met rebecca.. she was the first person to introduce me to the paranormal whenever i would spend the night at her house she would tell me scary stories in the dark as she would shine a flashlight over her face. i really didn’t believe the scary stories she told me until this one particular night..

we had just went to dinner & a movie with her parents. when i would spend the night we would have a bedtime, and it was 8pm, exactly on the dot. but rebecca and i never followed that rule, whenever we knew her parents went to sleep we would go downstairs and watch tv in the living room.

so we did that, that one particular night. as we sat on the couch she started telling me that she would see this man & his dog every single night, he usually minded his business and didn’t speak. he would just wander around the house with his dog.

as the night went on, i thought to myself that rebecca was lying to me to try & scare me. you know how elementary schoolers are.. they often have a bad habit of lying. but as we sat there on the couch watching tv, i looked behind me and there was the man with his dog going up the staircase.. the man had a top hat and a tuxedo on and his dog was what looked to be a golden retriever. rebecca didn’t have a scared look on her face like i did.. i remember being so scared i had to sleep in my mom’s room for a couple weeks..

fitnesswholepizza,None,False,False,False,11op2y3,False,False,t3_11op2y3,"Was a skeptic, not so much now","So my wife and I live in an apartment at my parents house. My father, who is a huge skeptic, has been having strange experiences off and on for years he hasn’t talked about until recently.  The death of a person in the family and a family pet has seemed to bring things out even more so. 

My best friend is into stuff like this, he’s a medium of sorts I guess. I’m not sure what exactly to call him. I called him to come by. He said there was definitely an energy at the house, a couple different things. Nothing that was harmful in any way though. Advised my dad to put a cross above the door and see if that helps. Which it did. That was about a month ago. 

So now the last couple weeks out of nowhere I have been feeling all sorts of different. Like a sudden depression and insecurity that I’ve never felt. It was starting to effect me in strange ways. Especially a heavy feeling of anxiety. Not typical for me at all. My wife doesn’t have that feeling but has seen a shadow, and a white outline of a person in our apartment a few times in the last month.  I’ve seen an outline of a guy in a hat, when I told my wife she turned white. Same guy. 

Long story short I have a cross that was blessed by a priest long ago in storage in the basement. All day today I’ve been having the heavy feeling, so I figured I’d try putting that cross above our door. Within 5 minutes of having that in my pocket the feeling disappeared. It’s currently above my door and staying there.

Imaginary-Traffic-80,None,False,False,False,11oupv7,False,False,t3_11oupv7,Paranormal Activity on MT Ranch," 

I don’t know how many people will read this or how many will believe it, and frankly I don’t care. I know that this really happened, my brother knows it, and even local law enforcement believe some of it. I even have pictures that I will upload if this gets any attention. This happened on a ranch that my brother and I lease in eastern Montana. If you would like more information you will have to private message me. 

The ranch in question is massive, covering about 18 sections (a section is one square mile, or 640 acres) and is two thirds deeded, with the rest being either BLM or state owned.  This land is incredibly rugged, being covered in clay hills and deep canyons, and is for the most part unfenced. There are several buffalo-jumps on the ranch, where hundreds of years ago the Indians would chase herds of buffalo off cliffs to their deaths. You can still find buffalo bones at these sites. Supposedly the ranch was also the site of a massacre, where an entire village of Hidatsa were killed by their enemies the Sioux, although I haven’t found any actual records of that incident. 

Also on the ranch are two abandoned homesteads on the ranch, the Mindt place and the Carter place (These are fake names as the families still live in the area and I would like to keep their information private). The Mindt homestead is merely one mile off of a county road and relatively easy to access, so my brother and I still use the dated cattle pens that are a part of it. The Carter place is more remote however, only being accessible on horseback as the trail that went to it washed out many years ago. All that is left of the Carter place is a log cabin with the roof caving in, an old corral system and a barn that has toppled over. The last people that lived in the Carter house was the Carter family themselves, but during the 1930’s the father went crazy and murdered the entire family before turning the gun on himself. At least that’s what people said. 

The ranch’s current owner’s live in California, and have owned the ranch since purchasing it from the Mindt family sometime during the 1980’s. My brother and I began leasing the ranch in 2007. There was some unusual activity at first (mainly random lights), but nothing that couldn't be explained in a reasonable way. The strangeness began in 2017, after a well was drilled on the property. I wonder now if this may have unleashed something. 

During the fall of 2017, I was searching for strays on horseback when I was approached by two frantic hunters. These hunters claimed that they were being stalked by a pack of wolves, but I was dismissive, as there had not been a wolf in this area since the 1920s. The hunters claimed that they knew the difference between wolves and coyotes, and were absolutely certain that what was stalking them was wolves. Whatever it was had seriously bothered them.

Later in the year, when we were trucking cattle away from the ranch and back to the home place, we found out that we were a dozen head short. Despite us running six hundred cattle on the property, we kept very close tabs on the herd and it was unusual to lose more than 2. But no matter how many times we searched and recounted, we could not find the missing cattle. This began a trend, and so far since 2017 there have been a total of 138 unaccounted cattle, a financial loss of $165,000.

Though there are many odd events that I could recount, there is one that stands out. This took place in October of 2020. Myself, my brother, and my brother’s eldest son were gathering the cattle and herding them to the Mindt homestead, where they could be loaded on trucks and taken to our home ranch for the winter. By this point the weird activity on the ranch had increased, so much so that we never went to the ranch without being armed. This day was no exception, and strapped to the saddle under my left leg was a Winchester 30-30 rifle. The morning went well, and by noon we had gathered two hundred head which we penned up at the Mindt place. After eating a quick lunch, my brother and nephew loaded their horses and left. My nephew had a football game later that day. I stayed alone and rode north west, toward the Carter homestead.

The first strange thing to happen was when I rode down a canyon. As I was riding I could hear multiple howls and cries coming from all directions. I cannot describe what these howls sounded like, because they were like nothing I had heard before or since. As I continued riding in the canyon I was overcome with a feeling of dread. My horse, Ace, seemed to pick up on this as well, and began spooking at almost every shadow. This was very out of character for him, as he was usually a very calm and collected horse.

The second strange thing was when I approached the Carter homestead. As I crested a hill in front of it, something jumped out of the old log cabin and ran in the opposite direction. I was still close to a mile away, so I had to use my binoculars to get a better look. What I saw through the lenses chilled me to the bone. It was a wolf, but it was massive, and solid black. It was so large that it could be mistaken for a black bear, but it was undeniably canine. After seeing the wolf my gut told me to turn around and come back later with company, but I ultimately continued. Throughout the course of the afternoon I managed to convince myself that the wolf I saw was nothing more than a coyote, and that its black fur was just a shadow.

It was nearing dusk before I arrived back at the Mindt place, herding thirty head of cattle in front of me. After I penned the cattle up I led Ace back to my pickup and horse trailer. From a distance I could see there was something wrong with the trailer, and as I approached I found that the axel had come apart. It didn’t make any sense to me as it was fine when I drove in, and there was no explanation as to what could have made it come apart when it wasn’t moving. By this time it was fairly dark outside, and as we were coming out the next day I decided to unhook the trailer and leave Ace at the corrals overnight. When I left I saw three blue lights near the corrals, but I attributed these lights to hunters so I continued driving. I also heard some more of the howls I had heard earlier in the day.

When all three of us arrived the next morning we found the corrals in a total mess. All the grass was turned up inside the corrals where the cattle had been milling, and the fence was broken in several places. The cattle that were penned up the night before were nowhere to be found, along with Ace. My brother and nephew took off on horseback to try to locate some of the cattle and Ace, but only managed to find around twenty head. As I was without a horse we repaired the trailer and left later in the afternoon.

The next day all three of us rode, and we searched exclusively for Ace. During this time I covered a lot of country that I would have otherwise missed, and I discovered more bizarre things. At the bottom of one canyon were hundreds of holes, about one foot in diameter and three foot deep. These holes had to have been dug by people, as there would be no animal that would have dug them. I also found a bone pile, which was exceptionally strange. There were the carcasses of four cows, all piled on top of each other, in an area that they typically would not have accessed. At first I thought that this was the act of poachers who were illegally killing and butchering cattle at the ranch, but there would have been no way to get to this location with a pickup or a four wheeler for that matter. The more we searched, the less sense everything made. 

We searched for three days before we came across something. My brother radioed me (as there was no cell service) that he believed he had found Ace. My nephew and I rode to his location, and sure enough at the bottom of a sinkhole (sinkholes are very common in this area, so its presence was not unusual) was the carcass of Ace, along with three cows. The sinkhole was at the bottom of a canyon, with the walls of this canyon being three hundred feet tall, the sinkhole being another twenty feet deep. It took an hour just to climb down the canyon walls. When I finally approached the sinkhole I found Ace to be heavily mutilated. Both ears were removed, along with the eyes, nostrils and hooves. The back half of him was not exposed but it looked like his tail was also removed. The cows surrounding him also had similar mutilations.

As was the case with the howls, the wolf, and the trailer, none of this made sense. It would have been almost impossible for just one cow to end up in this location, let alone three cows and a horse. There were also no tracks leading into or out of the sinkhole or canyon. The sheriff and veterinarian were both notified and an investigation was launched. The ultimate conclusion was that something had caused the cattle to spook and break out of the corrals, and whatever it was spooked them so bad that they ran all the way from Mindt place to the bottom of the sinkhole, in which they perished. When I mentioned the wolf I had seen, they were dismissive, just as I had been when the hunters told me of the wolf three years prior. No foul play was suspected, and the case was closed. 

Though there were many strange things that have happened since then, there were none quiet as upsetting as the loss of my horse. Cattle continued to go missing, and we now only ride the place in pairs. My brother and I are thinking about terminating the lease as for the moment the current cattle losses are unsustainable. I’ve always been a big YouTube watcher, and found that many stories on the site came from Reddit, so I decided to share mine. Though I don’t have any pictures of Ace in the sinkhole (my phone was destroyed in an unrelated incident and I didn’t have my files backed up), I do have pictures of a separate bone pile and some of the ranch.

PatientDisastrous839,None,False,False,False,11omxyx,False,False,t3_11omxyx,The Figure on the Cove,"  

In Ireland, you’re never far from the sea. I’m very used to my proximity to the water, in a way that I imagine many of you aren’t due simply to geography. I was born on the north coast of Ireland, technically in Northern Ireland, near Ballycastle, a small town up there. Like most coastal towns, our part of the world comes alive in the summer with people from all over, but in the winter, it is quite barren and isolated.

Unlike most people, it was that time of the year beginning in late autumn and running through to the middle of spring that I enjoy the sea most. There’s something quite special about having access to sprawling beaches when most people don’t bother to give them a chance. Even on dull days, the roar of the sea in all its expanse calms me, particularly at dawn and dusk when the light of the sky makes the water glimmer with a mystery that I can’t characterise.

\*\*\*

My story begins and ends with the sea. Before I really begin, I’d like to give you a brief rundown of selkie, or silkie, lore. Selkies are a type of being who, legend has it, inhabit the seas around the northern British Isles, although they can be traced as far as Iceland. The sea north of Ireland is inhabited by seals, and it isn’t uncommon to see a colony of seals, or perhaps an individual, further out from the towns. I don’t know if there exists an animal more charming than a seal, with its lively bark and its smiling face, so like that of a human. 

The selkie takes the form of a seal but is really a being with the ability to remove its coat and take on a human-like form. Traditionally, tales speak of selkies appearing as beautiful women, but if you delve deep into folklore selkies appear in all kinds of human forms. Legend has it that they appear in groups on moonlit beaches at certain times during the year, far from human eyes. Here they will remove their seal coats and take on their human bodies, dancing with jubilance to music under the light of the moon before eventually returning to the sea. 

It sounds like a very innocent myth, but there is a darker side to the selkie. Ireland isn’t a large country, and so relatively speaking you can never be too far from humanity and civilisation. If misfortune strikes and a human catches sight of a group of selkies, they will dart to their coats and make their way back to the sea without hesitation. If, however, the human takes hold of one of the coats – their skin - then the selkie is bound to him. The selkie cannot return home without this. Consequently, stories tell of men taking selkies as wives, keeping the seal skin hidden away. The selkie will never stop longing for its home and family but will be trapped in the home of their captor for the remainder of their lives unless they are able to recapture their lost coat. Most would never succeed in doing so.

\*\*\*

Like most myths, I would have always taken selkies with a pinch of salt. That is, until I was seventeen, and I had my own experience that really is unexplainable unless we place some credence on selkie lore. 

As I say, I was born by the coast, just outside of town. Teenage life can be challenging for anyone, but for me this was amplified by being a queer person in a very small community. It wasn’t easy, but I found some solace in nature, which, as I said, provided me with headspace at a time when I needed it more than anything. Ironically, the best tonic for my sense of isolation was isolation: a self-built isolation on those evenings when I could walk the ten minutes to the beach and enjoy the setting sun, which made the water glisten with hope and that unexplainable sense of mystery. I spent hours down there, particularly on those cold days when contact with other people would be minimal.

Mostly there wouldn’t be much to say about these evenings. I would walk and walk and walk, and eventually begin to switch off. Not terribly exciting, but steady and constant. There was one evening, however, when my path took a different turn.

There was a section of the beach that was somewhat shrouded by dunes and rocks; a quiet cove a few miles down from the side of the beach I started at. We were deep in spring at this point – I know this because I could never have made it this far along the sand in the winter months when daylight was minimal. I was trying to maximise my time here before the tourist season began and the area would begin to fill with people from all over.

On the beach, I was stricken by the sight of what looked like a young man. The light was beginning to dim, and the sea had a purply hue. He was strewn out on the sand, his form slender and somehow gentle. It would have been somewhat unusual to see someone this far out along the beach at this time of year, but not altogether shocking. What *was* shocking was that he was entirely naked, with not a single item of clothing in sight, either on his body or on the sand. 

I’ll inform you now that although winter had ended, an Irish spring is hardly warm. It isn’t rare for snow to fall as late as March and April, and the wind, particularly by the sea, is biting and at times relentless. You can understand my shock then upon seeing this naked figure on the beach that day. What made it more bewildering was that his body appeared to glimmer. It was as though he was formed from a matter related to the sea before us, which gleamed in much the same way. His pale skin imitated its hue, moving softly with the sun to create something that transfixed me. 

Ordinarily I’d have been deeply embarrassed by anything related to nudity or sex; I was an awkward seventeen year old from rural Ireland. But this was different; in the same way that the sea at this time of day calmed me and soothed me, it was as though he had inspired the same effect, though somehow magnified. I lost track of the time spent in that spot. I’m embarrassed to write now that I stood staring at what I thought was a naked man for any amount of time, but I can only be honest.

And then it was over. He opened his eyes suddenly and appeared to become stiff in a way that contrasted with his until then relaxed form. I saw him turn his eyes to me, which widened in shock. These eyes, I remember, were striking even from a slight distance. They were grey, but startling so, almost sinking into the whiteness that surrounded them like watercolour and piercing despite the lack of hue. His entire form was one pale, glistening shape that melded together and appeared translucent in the dimming light.

He quickly and soundlessly rose to his feet and moved with a sharp fluidity to the rocks behind him. Still frozen, I watched as he emerged from the rocks carrying what looked like a silvery piece of cloth, which matched his own body. I say cloth, but it did not move in the wind, which was blowing in from the sea. It seemed solid and heavy, but he carried it effortlessly to the sea at a fast pace, eyes staring intently at me the entire time.

When he reached the sea, he stepped into the water with the coat and buried himself in the waves. And then he was gone.

At this, I shook myself back to life, and moved towards the shore myself. Much as I tried, I could not make out his form anywhere. He had vanished into the roaring water soundlessly and without any physical trace. I was bemused but exhilarated. I remained there for around ten minutes more before making my way home, the images of the evening etched into my mind for the duration of the walk, which was guided by the light of the now fully risen moon.

\*\*\*

My parents were frustrated when I reached my house, upset that I had been out for much longer than they had expected, but their words seemed to drift over my head. I was quiet as a teenager, and I imagine it wasn’t surprising to them that I didn’t have much to say, no matter their frustration.

I didn’t speak to anyone at the time about what I had encountered on that evening. Being a bit of an outcast already, I hardly wanted to appear even odder, and it would be a few years before I really found a group of friends with whom I could mull these thoughts over with. I did however spend the next weeks burying myself in online literature about anything that might have been connected to the image of the figure on the beach. I came across selkie stories and immersed myself in selkie lore. Although it didn’t entirely match what I had seen, it was the only mythos I could find that was somewhat similar.

I returned to that part of the beach many times, especially in summer when daylight was much more generous. It saddened me then that I never came across the being I had seen that night. On one occasion, however, I had resigned myself to walking back home when I heard a bark coming from the shore. I was delighted to see three silvery seals in the water, a few metres out into the sea. They moved playfully, their voices filling the air. It struck me that one, a little smaller than the other two, was looking at me watchfully, its small eyes intent. The light of the setting sun hit its body, which sparkled with its rays, and I smiled back, waving slightly. 

I don’t know if this was the being I had seen that evening some months before; it may have been, or it may just have been an ordinary, albeit beautiful, seal. What I do know is that I didn’t want to disturb him or frighten him, so after waving I began my walk home. I pray that, whoever or whatever he was, he knows now that I meant no harm to him when I encountered him enjoying the evening light on the cove. Rather, I would love to be able to communicate to him how much seeing him meant to me, and how much peace it brought to my mind to see one other creature enjoying the glory and beauty of nature on a spring evening in Ireland.",4,17.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11omxyx/the_figure_on_the_cove/,False,2023-03-11 15:30:01,False,False,False,0.95,,,,

theaudiophiile,None,False,False,False,11p1t3t,False,False,t3_11p1t3t,Has anyone else heard mysterious noises in their residential neighborhood?,"Currently working from home while my company moves offices. My work day was very recently interrupted by a very strange noise that I can best describe as a ""pulsing saw bass riser"" such as I would find in one of my VST packs. Imagine the saw bass synth from the beginning or Science Is Fun from the Portal 2 soundtrack, but slowly getting louder and higher in pitch before stopping just as suddenly as it has started. It was loud enough that I felt my home office shake a bit. 

My first thought was that it almost sounded like a plane flying overheard. I live near an airport, but to be THAT LOUD it would have had to have been flying VERY low, which is unlikely considering I live in a planned development in a heavily residential area. I didn't see any lights or evidence of a plane or any flying object outside either, and after the noise cut off I didn't hear ANY noises, outside or inside, besides the sound of my own breathing and typing. This is incredible strange because, prior to the start of the sound, I'd heard my cats running around inside, and children playing/cars driving outside my house. I didn't hear any sounds outside of my own for about 5 minutes in total after the noise cut out.

I've never heard anything like this before, both in my neighborhood and elsewhere. I have no rational explanation, and no idea of WHAT could have made the noise.

This story starts off with them in the cemetery hanging out like usual near their village. Keep in mind these are mountainous places with forests, and there are a lot of villages. It was dark in the cemetery and he and his friends were walking along near these wilderness places when they saw some people in the distance. Being thuggish (if that's a word), they started to walk towards the people. They looked *weird*. Human looking, sure, but their clothes were so outdated as if it was decades ago. He said, ""HEY!"". The group continued walking to them, and the weird people continued walking and paying no mind. The group was yelling, but they continued walking and eventually the weird group was walking slowly and laughing at the group of friends as if playing with them. At this point, they get angry they're laughing and want to mug them basically. ""What village are you from!?"" He yelled, but they continued. They started picking up the pace, then running, then sprinting, but they just couldn't catch up to the weird 'people' when they were walking slowly.

Back again in my childhood home where we last left off with the Kitchen Walker. This time around the topic is the ""Weeping Cabinet"" in the dining room. By the time my mom divorced my dad, we had long since turned the dining room into anything but. It was my brother's room,my dad's room, a play room, and a man cave. The dining room is directly connected to the kitchen, where the Kitchen Walker's domain is. In said dining room were these two glass china cabinets that we had put my dad's old Coca-Cola memorabilia and action figure collection in. 

When my mom moved out my dad took her old room (known as Alcatraz, cause it felt separated from the house and the boiler heating system rattled like you wouldn't believe) and we turned the dining room into the man cave. We had a TV and a futon set up in the middle of the room with the cabinets to the left of the TV. 

Flash forward a year and my dad is packing up and moving out across town. I'm spending the night at dad's and am in the man cave. I got my back to the cabinets and it's around 1:00 in the morning. I suddenly get a feeling like my heart is exploding and my eyes start uncontrollably tearing up. I know for a fact I'm being watched, by something standing in front of the cabinets. Just off to the left in my periphery there is this faceless entity with black just dripping from it's chin, like tears streaming down it's face. 

This entity, which has shown up for the first time, just stands there, and watches me while I uncontrollably sob for half an hour. You could feel it's emotions and tell it was sad, not mad. That made it all the harder to bear. 

You see, those same cabinets for years would rattle to me and would move the action figures, clink Coke bottles together, and I'd even hear it sing. My dad had an old Coca-Cola speaker without batteries but I still remember hearing occasional nursery rhymes, ""London Bridge"", ""Ring Around the Rosie"", and ""This Little Light of Mine"" to name a few. 

I will go to my grave with the firm belief that the poor ghost wept for our departure. I never got to know it like I did ""Bethany the Hall Ghost"" or ""The Kitchen Walker"" but I will miss it dearly, and I hope if someone takes up residence in that house, they too will be friendly to spectors.

rose801216,None,False,False,False,11pghci,False,False,t3_11pghci,Dark Mama in the Woods,"This happened about six years ago when my son was four, I believe. We were with a group of friends at a hotel/resort in the woods for a weekend. They had cabins, hiking, usual outdoor stuff, and provided meals. It was lovely. 

On the second night, they set up a bonfire, so we were all sitting around and talking. My son stood up and had his back to the fire and kept yelling to the dark woods ""Come on, it's okay,"" and ""Come over here."" We thought it was just a strange four year old imagination and didn't think much about it. Eventually we went back to our cabin for the night. 

The next morning a friend told me some information that made the whole situation way more, more.... The resort was run by a husband and wife team, who were also raising their granddaughter. The granddaughter's mom, their daughter, had completely disappeared. She had had drama in her life, but when she left, she was gone, no traces. There was fear that she had been killed. Her parents hired people to try and find her though, done everything they could (maybe still are), understandably. 

The thing is, when we asked our son who he was talking to the night before, he told us he was calling the Dark Mama. Under the circumstances, I could never help but wonder if the Dark Mama is the missing daughter/mom. 

I could never find anything in the news about her unusual disappearance, but that story did fit with my son's behavior a little too well to be easily disregarded.

Livid_Cabinet_9197,None,False,False,True,11p62gr,False,False,t3_11p62gr,Strange noises from the woods,"Hey guys, I’m uploading this immediately after hearing it. To provide some context, I live on a 20 acre horse ranch in the pandhandle of Florida, about a half hour from the Alabama border, and 15 minutes ago I heard the strangest “animal” sounds I’ve ever heard. It happened almost right outside the property, which is only about 50 feet away from where I am right now. 
It was a very, very loud whistle. I heard it 4x, spaced out by like 15-30 seconds, each whistle was different, no repeating tunes or notes, and was loud enough to sound like it was echoing across the property.
After the 4 whistles, it was followed up with an almost “sigh” sound, then nothing …

So to sum it up, it sounded like somebody was facing the property just outside the fence line whistling 4 different tunes, followed by an almost frustrated sigh then silence. 
What’s even more strange is it was dead quiet while this was happening, shortly after the silence I could hear a pack of coyotes in the distance which happens all the time, and owls over the lake, which is also frequent.
 Also to be clear, where the sound was coming from is open field, it’s just so dark outside I can’t see in front of my face.

The weirdest thing is we’re more likely to hear gunshots than other people out here. The closest neighbors are like a half mile away in the other direction. This sound came from the road side of the property, the closest neighbors in that direction are even further than a half mile.

And we have 2 donkeys on the property to ward off predators and I didn’t hear either of them warning the herd, which would mean that maybe it was a human I was hearing? But like I said the property is fenced and gated so they would need to hop the fence… and whistling is a weird thing to do when you’re trespassing in an area where shooting is common.

Anybody have any ideas?

JLRik,None,False,False,False,11pddzi,False,False,t3_11pddzi,Paranormal or simply paranoid?,"Hi all! I’ve had a lot of worsening anxiety and hormonal problems recently, so I’m not sure if I’m overthinking or if my home could have something paranormal going on. I’m new to this community, so if I’m doing something wrong please let me know.

The home we live in was my boyfriend’s grandmother’s home. She was the only person to ever live here. It was built for her by her son (my boyfriend’s father), and is on said son’s property (an estate with multiple buildings, all only occupied by immediate family), so it was quite the significant space for her. She willed the home to my boyfriend, who I already lived with, so we moved here last fall.

The only interesting thing that happened prior to us moving is my boyfriend’s father mentioning that outdoor lights had started turning on and off on their own. They worked on some sort of electrical thing, and it solved the issue. There is also a lamp in the house that does the same. We don’t have an explanation for the lamp.

I had never noticed anything out of the ordinary until about a month ago. The house has always been sort of noisy in general (the water heater is ultra clanky, acorns fall on the skylights, birds hit windows, squirrels tap at the glass doors, lots of wildlife around, noises in the hall are amplified into the bedroom/closet due to layout…lots of easily explained noises that would catch you off guard if you didn’t know what they were.) 

A month ago, we brought home a puppy. While this would typically feel extremely unrelated, the puppy’s birthday is one day away from the one year anniversary of his grandmother’s passing. She started her journey out of the living world on December 13th, 2021, which was the last day my boyfriend was with her. He stayed until about 11:55pm. She passed away minutes after he left, just after midnight on December 14th, 2021. Puppy was born late at night on December 13th, 2022 and came home on February 15th. For what it’s worth, which may be a lot, she did pass away in the home. 

The morning before we brought the puppy home, very early (around 4am. I am generally up around that time. I used to get up at 5 or 6, but it’s been 3 or 4am since we moved here) I was sitting in our sunroom admiring the fact that the very full moon was visible through our skylights. It isn’t generally aligned that way, and it was fascinating to look at the moon from inside my house. I have some photos I took on my phone, if anyone is interested. 

I saw what I felt was a shadow figure out of the corner of my eye, snapped my head to the left,  and it was gone. There is a tall grandfather clock right next to where I saw the figure, so I wrote it off as sleepiness and darkness making me see things. 

Now, we (mainly I) have started hearing noises we can’t explain. We frequently say “huh?” To each other because we heard talking, only to be met with a confused “I didn’t say anything.” We hear noises that sound like things hitting walls, loud pops, heavy objects falling, pipes bursting….but we never find the culprit. It always sounds like it’s damage being done to the home or inside of it. We both hear it, and typically so does the puppy. 

My boyfriend has been traveling for work more than usual, and the occurrences seem more frequent and intentional when he is gone or asleep. He is currently sleeping, and I am writing this after hearing what sounded like a suitcase crashing down in the hall closet. There’s nothing there. It woke the puppy from a deep sleep. 

Last week, I smelled fire in the living room, but only in the exact space she passed. This week, in the same spot, it smells very electrical and metallic sometimes. The lamp has started turning on and off again. A mop fell over in the bathroom while I was taking a shower. I hear dog toys squeak from the area I saw the figure in, but nothing squeaked them and the puppy doesn’t notice. This is usually when I’m in the bathroom and out of sight of that room (puppy follows me. It isn’t her.) 

Yesterday, the puppy brought me a past hospital bracelet of the grandmother’s. I don’t know where it came from. I know there was one in a drawer of keepsakes, but there is no way pup had access to that and it’s still there.

SnooDrawings9369,None,False,False,False,11p8tum,False,False,t3_11p8tum,Arsonist ghost?,"At exactly 12:34am, every smoke detector in our house went off.

Backstory: we bought this house about a month ago, first home. From night one, my fiancé and I have continued to witness unexplainable things around the home. The motion-detecting lights in the hall bathroom turning on in the middle of the night seems to be the number one hit, and I guess it should be mentioned that each time it’s happened, my fiancé and I and both dogs are present and accounted for in our bedroom down the hall. I keep having dreams of a woman in the house. I’ve caught my fiancé having conversations with himself when I was on the other side of the house, heard him talking, went to see who he was talking to, and he said he was talking to me. He was adamant that he saw me standing right behind him the whole time, but I was nowhere around. Stuff like that.

Anyway, tonight, we jumped out of bed to investigate the smoke detectors going off and found that, upstairs, a box had caught fire. Upstairs was thick, full of smoke. We were able to put it out pretty quickly before it turned serious, but he and I both agree there’s no explanation for the fire. We went to bed hours ago. The wooden box that was ablaze sits atop an antique dresser I recently purchased secondhand (not sure if that detail’s relevant, but I don’t want to miss anything in my recounting). It’s a small wooden box, the contents of which being a large sage smudge stick which I’ve probably had for over a year now, along with a bundle of incense sticks, and a small glass bottle of sandalwood oil. The smudge stick was burned all the way down to ashes, every single stick of incense was lit, but all of them only about a quarter of the way down, and the plastic lid to the bottle of oil was completely melted from the outside. Now, the timing for these items’ burning also seems strange, to me. This large stick of sage would take hours to burn all the way down, which it was, but the incense sticks all being only burned a quarter of the way down means they lit from the top maybe about 15-20 minutes ago?

Anyway, no one was up there. Like I said, we’d been in bed for hours. There are no electronics near the box, no batteries, there is a candle but it wasn’t lit and it was untouched by the fire, there are no lighters or matches near, and I just can’t think of a single rational explanation other than the paranormal.

I used to think it was the AC doing this since my room used to be next to the unit, but everytime time I would lay down in my bed, the edge of my bed would shake. It would shake like some kid was sitting on the edge of it and just bouncing up and down.

This happened for years, up until I moved out. I never really looked into it, i would be down reading or playing my 3DS, right when I laid down, the shaking started.

One day, while visiting my parents, I decided to lay in my bed in my old room. Like clockwork, the shaking started again. This time, I whipped out my phone and turned on Snapchat. Since I saw all those TikTok’s of ghost being captured with a filter, I thought “…there’s no way.”

Right when I turned on the filter, two faces appeared: one at the corner of my room, the other by my bed. One upside down and the other normal. The shaking stopped. The one upside down immediately went away. The other came closer to the camera. I literally said out loud “GOT YOU, yeaaah see it shows your face.” The one face got larger, like it came closer to my phone. Then it disappeared.

The shaking stopped. Every now and again, I try to see if it would happened again when I visit. No more shaking.",4,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11pgz3y/i_think_i_scared_away_two_ghosts_that_haunted_me/,False,2023-03-12 15:17:58,False,False,False,0.72,,,,
Moto-XL,None,False,False,True,11pfhef,False,False,t3_11pfhef,Ghosts: Real or Imagined? The answer may depend on your perspective. (Theory),"[ Note: These are just my thoughts, and I have left out environmental factors to keep it simple. ]

I personally don't believe in ghosts because I believe that when you die, there is no avoiding the afterlife. But, that doesn’t mean I’m not willing to keep an open mind and be interested in sightings that people claim. Let's say that ghosts are real. In that case, there is either no afterlife or there is a way to avoid or escape it.

The idea of ghosts is a topic of much debate, with some people believing in their existence and others being skeptical. Those who do not believe in ghosts may view claims of ghost sightings as being the result of underlying health or psychological issues, such as hallucinations or delusions. While it is true that some individuals may experience hallucinations or delusions, it is important to approach claims of ghost sightings with an open mind and not dismiss them without careful consideration. Many people report experiencing ghost sightings and other paranormal events, and these experiences cannot always be easily explained away by medical conditions.

There are two scenarios that could explain the existence of ghosts. In the first scenario, ghosts are real, but there is no afterlife. This would mean that since there are more people who have died than there are currently living, every household would have multiple spirits. Ghosts would be a part of everyday life, and people would be interacting with them regularly. However, this is not the case.

In the second scenario, ghosts are real, but there is an afterlife. This would suggest that ghosts only appear when there is a reason behind it, such as a person being responsible for their death or the ghost trying to warn them. If this scenario is true, it would mean that the average person on earth would never interact with a ghost, and most sightings are fake, with only a small percentage being true. Or that some people who report seeing ghosts may have unique characteristics or experiences that make them more susceptible to these sightings. For example, they may be more intuitive, sensitive, or empathic.

The idea of ghosts and the paranormal is a highly debated topic, and while some people believe in their existence, others may be more skeptical. For many individuals, believing in something requires concrete evidence or proof, and claims of ghost sightings may not meet this standard. As such, it is understandable that the average person may struggle to believe in ghosts or other paranormal phenomena that they cannot prove exists because they will never interact with them. 

This does not necessarily mean that ghosts do not exist. It simply means that they are not a part of the average person's reality.

This also presents a Schrodinger’s cat effect, where both the existence and non-existence of ghosts can be true at the same time.",6,8.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/11pfhef/ghosts_real_or_imagined_the_answer_may_depend_on/,False,2023-03-12 14:13:20,False,False,False,0.84,,,,

Like the title says my GF is being haunted & I want to help. Problem is I have no idea where to start. I've searched around a bit & have no leads as to what this thing even is. Any help would be GREATLY appreciated.
Here is what I do know about it along with some general background knowledge. 


 -The being has only ever appeared to her in reflections, specifically windows to my knowledge.

 -It's only shown its head in the reflection, with her only being able to make out two eyes & a smile at one point.

 -It seems to be able to interact with electronics to some extent, having drained her & her friends phone when she had first encountered it. 

 -It can interact with her to some extent, having created a shock like feeling on her neck twice, flicking one of her fingers, & touching her arm.

 -It can mimic voices, having mimicked one of her friends voices when she first encountered it & my voice at one point. Tho all it did was copy what I said. 

 -It said the names of 3 of her exs at one point, then my name.

 -It made her room smell like smores. We have a working theory that it might be connect to her experiencing her first crush while camping due to the previous statement but are unsure. 

 -It was originally targeting a friend of hers before she stood up to it & it started messing with her.

 -The being CAN be seen in photos, since my gfs friend had taken a photo of it & sent it to her. I am unsure if she still had it but will ask for it when she wakes up. (She's sleeping rn after some stuff that went down so I wanna let her rest.)

 -Whenever the being is near she gets an unsettled feeling & has the feeling of being watched. She said it felt like she was spinning while standing complete still.

 -The being has only answered one question she's asked, which was ""What are you?"" To which it responded ""reflection."" We think that has something to do with why it only appears in windows but we don't know. 

 -My gfs mom is a practicing witch & has done rituals to keep malicious entities out of the house.

 -Ever sence the being started messing with her she has had negative responses to touching items with positive energy. Her hands burning blessed crystals for example.

 -The friend who initially was being targeteds mom dabbled in some witchcraft.

I was home alone at the time as both of my parents were at work. I slept at around 11 am and after like an hour and a half I could hear my telephone ringing but weirdly it all felt extremely creepy. On top of that, it was extremely windy so the curtains were going wild and other doors kept banging plus there was someone at the door was ringing my doorbell constantly. As I was still not wholly awake I was confused as to wtf was happening. Rushing I picked up the telephone but there was a disturbance on the other side and all I could hear was static, I was even more confused then but suddenly I started feeling a sharp pain in my head and I kinda fell to my side but somehow gaining my balance I went to the door to answer it as someone was constantly ringing the doorbell. When I opened it, ya'll already know, there was no one NO ONE I SWEAR YALL. I rushed inside and was still extremely confused as to wtf just happened but my head was still in pain so I decided to go to sleep. After my nap, I decided to check the call records as to who had called me, and to my utter surprise, it showed that there were no calls received after 8 am. Though I'm pretty sure all of that did happen as I could still feel a lil pain inside my head. to this day I'm creeped out by this incident.",4,7.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghosts/comments/11pbgc9/a_weird_encounter_which_still_makes_me_confused/,False,2023-03-12 10:35:18,False,False,False,0.89,,,,
GuyFierisHairGel,None,False,False,False,11p6sr6,False,False,t3_11p6sr6,Can’t account for over an hour of time while driving,"I am new to this sub even though I am a longtime believer, so I hope it’s ok that I’m sharing this experience from two nights ago. I’m not sure what we experienced but I’ve spent the last 48 hours trying to figure it out and I’m stumped. Hoping someone here might have an idea. 

So my husband and I drove from NYC to DC/NOVA the other night at 8pm. We’ve done this drive dozens of times in both directions and we typically leave at night because we prefer night driving. No matter what it, takes us anywhere from 3 hours 45 minutes to 4 hours 30 minutes, except when there’s major construction, or an accident, or just crazy traffic. 

When I checked GPS as we left it was 8:04pm. Our ETA was 12:08am, so it was predicting a 4hr 4min drive, which is normal. I’m positive this time is correct because my husband picked me up from work and we hit the road immediately. 

We stopped one time for a drive through dinner and to walk our dog. This was an approximately 30 min stop. We didn’t need to fill up on gas because my husband filled it up before he picked me up. There was no traffic at any point of the drive or construction projects that decreased highway lanes. 

Anyway, all this is to say that we got to our destination at 1:45am, a full hour plus (taking into account our dinner pit stop) later than we should have. Neither of us realized this until we pulled into my in-laws driveway, and at that point we were both tired and just wanted to get to bed. 

The next morning we were chatting our family and they asked why we were so late getting in and when we tried to explain it we couldn’t. There’s nothing that makes sense for us getting to our destination as late as we did. No wrong turns, no traffic, no extra stops. My husband, the driver, says he got really drowsy at one point and was thinking about pulling over to a rest stop to stretch but then had a sudden burst of energy and didn’t need to. 

This was not a particularly spooky or compelling experience, but I just can’t account for that extra hour. This is a drive we do very frequently and it’s never been a nearly 6 hour trip for us. Any ideas of what could have happened? I tried to list all relevant details here but if there’s anything else I can elaborate on I’d be happy to do that in the comments.",7,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11p6sr6/cant_account_for_over_an_hour_of_time_while/,False,2023-03-12 05:52:54,False,False,False,0.8,,,,

ThrowRAlineforhelp,None,False,False,False,11px50f,False,False,t3_11px50f,The Creepiest Used Bookstore Ever (for me)...,"Lately I have been thinking about some of my experiences from my late teens/early 20s and I was thinking about a visit to Cape Cod with my now ex-girlfriend.  We were out driving along Route 6 in July after being at the beach and came across a small, locally owned used book store that was in an old building set back from the road.  There was a house close by to the building, which if I remember correctly, the building looked like a barn.  Everything was painted white on the outside.  


My ex and I loved books, so we decided to stop in and poke around.  I was looking for anything fantasy related...my ex was looking for anything fun to read.  We breezed right in and past the old woman (in her 70s or even 80s) sitting at the counter, who politely said hello and told us to ask if we had any questions.  It was your typical used book store of the era; small, cramped, shelves and piles of books everywhere and a slight musty smell.  We poked around a bit and the woman started calling out to us:  ""That book you have there is the first in the series and that is a first edition paperback..."" or ""Don't get that one, you won't enjoy it.  The story is a bit dated now.""  She kept talking to us, even though she wasn't in our line of sight.  She seemingly knew every book we picked up and started talking to us about it, even though she couldn't see us!  We finally settled on a couple of books and checked out.  The woman shakily took my money but couldn't find my hand to give me my change.  She then asked me ""Would you mind taking the coins out of my hand?  I'm blind and I can't find yours.""  All the hairs on the back on my neck stood on end.  My ex picked up the books and walked out while I finished up.  ""Such a nice girl,"" the woman said to me, ""Enjoy your time with her while you can.""  


""Excuse me?""  I asked.  ""Enjoy your time with her while you can,"" the woman said to me again, ""You never know what life is going to do to you.""  When I got in the car my girlfriend asked me to get us our of there.  ""I have goosebumps all over my body.  Please take me back to the hotel.""  We got out of there.  As it turns out, two years later the girlfriend became my ex-girlfriend and went hard no contact.  We haven't spoken in decades.  


The books we bought that day?  I don't know about my ex's, but my books all disappeared within a couple of weeks.  I never found the copies I bought (A copy of the Hobbit and the LOTR trilogy, if I remember correctly...I had never finished it and was going to give another go).  


Years later I returned to the Cape and tried to find that bookstore again.  My now wife and I drove all along Route 6 and never found it.  It was possible I have the location wrong, or it was torn down.  But I can't forget the experience that the woman knew every single book one of us touched, knew all about the book we were looking at, and could tell us all about it even though she literally couldn't see us.  Maybe it is a paranormal experience, maybe not as serious as some people have, but still the weirdest one I have had.",7,79.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11px50f/the_creepiest_used_bookstore_ever_for_me/,False,2023-03-13 02:10:07,False,False,False,0.99,,,,

When I was 18 I found an Ouija board in my basement. This was before I knew about demons./Spirits . I tried using the board because I was bored one day and nothing happened. I knew nothing of the power of that board when I was using it. Nothing happened though when using it. I didn't put the indicator over goodbye when I finished. Apparently that's crucial?

I knew deep in my mind it was from the board and **no one else believed me.** I know now that demons work over night and festered into me that night to give me the psychosis that I still suffer today.

No Face Lady

My younger sister was 4 at the time and the first to see her. She started appearing to her about a month after we moved in. She told us about her, telling us a lady came into our room at night; but for a while no one else saw her. After my own run-in with Laura in the basement, though, I was totally willing to believe her. I asked her what she looked like. 

Her: ""She has no face.""
Me: ""What do you mean she has no face?"" 
Her: ""No eyes, no mouth.""
Me: ""But she has a nose?""
She pauses to think about this. She touches her own nose ""Her nose have no holes."" She starts getting restless and I can tell she's done talking about it so I don't press her anymore, but that description absolutely terrified me. 

At this point, we're already experiencing phantom footsteps and voices, I've experienced a full apparition and now so has my sister. I firmly decide we've moved into a legit haunted house. 

I bring these concerns to my parents. Mom, as you know by now, isn't having any of it at this time. Dad was more receptive, he believed that we believed it and although he hadn't experienced apparitions himself, he had experienced the voices and footsteps. He explained to Mom that kids were more open to things like this and that she should be more open minded. She, of course, just shrugged it off. She's stubborn 🙄. 

Anyway, another month or so goes by and one night I wake up in the wee hours of the morning to find my younger sister bolt upright in bed, staring toward the door. ""[REDACTED], what are you doing? You're supposed to be asleep."" I asked, still groggy. She shook her head and pointed toward the door. ""She's here."" 

Instantly, I am awake. I flip over and sit up and in the doorway, a tall woman with long, dark red hair is standing there. The longer I look, the more I realize everything about her is off, her fingers are grotesquely long, her skinny limbs don't quite fit her equally skinny body...but most striking is, just like my sister said, she doesn't have a face. It's just a blank slate with indentions where typical features would be. She looks like something attempting to be human but not quite making it. That sort of uncanny valley vibe. I freeze.(I guess that's my default fear reaction. I still do it.) 

She pays us absolutely no mind whatsoever. She sort of drifted into our closet and back out. Over to the window and then back to the closet and out the door and down the stairs. 

The next day I told Dad and he contacted a friend who said to sage our room, so he did, and we never saw her again.

Then these items end up at thrift stores and soon into someone news house. 

I was wondering on what you all think about this? I personally haven't noticed anything weird with it while growing up, but now everytime I visit my parents and see it I begin to wonder if that video had any truth to it.

narwalsareunicorns99,None,False,False,False,11pksfa,False,False,t3_11pksfa,I am forever haunted.,"Backstory: About 10-12 years ago I(10-15F now 23) and a few friends went to an old abandoned water mill where lots of deaths happened. Being a young, dumb kid we played with a ouija board. Well as expected it moved, creepy things happened and we all ran for our lives. I was the only one that didn’t go back and didn’t say goodbye to the board. I definitely opened a portal that will forever stay with me.


Fast-forward to the present: A lot of unexplained things happened over the years but recently have been getting bad. One that will always stick with me was when my poor dog got hurt. 


It started when I was hanging out in my living room watching tv. My dog was in her cage(bed rest from oral surgery) in my room. I heard loud bangs on my wall that was shared with the living room. I originally thought it was my dog shifting in her cage and just happened to move the cage against the wall. Then I heard a loud crash and my dog yelping. I ran into my room to find my light had blown and shattered all over my floor and my drugged up dog shaking with all her fur up in her cage. I got her out and put her in the living room in a makeshift cushion fort while I cleaned up the glass. After I checked up on her in the living room and light knocks were coming from my room on the wall shared with my living room. My dogs tail was broken at the base(I brought her to the vet first thing in the morning) and she refused to step foot back in my room. 


After I got so mad that something hurt my dog I yelled to whatever or whoever it was that if it touched my dog again I’ll make sure to send it right back to where it came from and it’s gonna have to go through me to get to her. I woke up to a huge bruise on my back the next morning and I got my house blessed by the church the same night. I now sage my house and myself weekly and a lot of the unexplained things calmed down a lot.

sacharyzmith,None,False,False,False,11pku6x,False,False,t3_11pku6x,Wondering about my paranormal experiences.,"Ok, so I've been scrolling this Reddit every once in a while for a couple of years now. Love reading in it, but I also love reading longer ones to keep me interested. I believe I may be able to fill some of your time if you're like me! This is also my first longer post, so forgive if it's long, but I can go into deep detail with these stories, and I aim to do just that. I also bring these stories here in search of any kind of answers about what these things were.

I will start by saying even having these experiences, I've always been a skeptic, my mother who's passed 9 years ago, was toward the end of her life, a deep believer, as well as both of my sisters, though after my mother's passing, they have not spoken much on the subject unless asked about it, but they can verify 3 of the 4 stories I'm about to lay out there as well. The first 3 of these stories take place in my childhood home in a trailer park that always seemed to have an odd vibe around it in general, never found anything weird out about it, but we always had this theory like Indian burial grounds or something, though I doubt it, just a weird little rural area of southwest Michigan. The 4th story takes place at my father and stepmothers house, about 8 miles north of the house the first 3 stories take place in. I'll start with what I feel is the least intense, moving to the ones that still spark great fear in me.

Story 1) I'll start with the story at my father and stepmothers house. As it's pretty simple. I lived there in my early 20s and had the classic downstairs basement room, I was the black sheep of sorts, so it was only fitting to put me there. We had a dog that always stayed with me, especially when the family was out doing whatever. This happened multiple times, but I'll share the last time I remember it happening; I'm sitting downstairs hanging out, YouTube or whatever I was doing, when my dog like he normally does when people come home, starts going NUTS. Barking and pacing for me to let him upstairs so he can greet whoever he believes came through the door, as I get out of my chair to let him do so, I hear the classic footsteps of what I believe is my little brother, as they're too fast to be my father or stepmom, I hear them go all the way back to the back of the house and stay there, so I let the dog out, and I follow suit thinking maybe my folks need help grabbing something they may have brought home. Get upstairs, nothing at all, lights off, no one home, dog is even thinking ""well what the hell?"". Now, at this point, this is the 4th or 5th time this has happened in the few years we'd been living there. Mostly starting in the latter part of those years. So this time, I felt ballsy about it, I decided like an idiot to just ask if anyone was there. No answer. So I go further into the house facing the hallway leading to the back of the house to a couple of bedrooms, I put myself in a bathroom so that when I yell at it, I won't see down the hallway when it comes to get my sorry ass. But I get in the bathroom and like an idiot I somewhat angrily yelled ""who the fuck is in my house?"" At this point I uear something fall in the back bathroom between the two bedrooms, I poke my head out to verify no one is there, check the garage to see no one is there, and then went back downstairs where I waited for people to actually come home. It's not the wildest story ever, but eerie to me. 

Story 2) This is where, to me, these stories amp up and really get freaky. Just something about this trailer park/the trailer I lived in, thisnwas after loving in the same trailer with my mom, who my dad then took over after their divorce and was now living there with my steomom.... So I remember it being maybe 2006, I was maybe 13 or so, and at the time loved being up late as it was summer vacation from school, and this summer I liked smoking pot with my sister late at night in the backyard with the neighbor boy, this night, no pot, just us 3 hanging out smoking cigarettes and talking. For some reason or another my sister takes her phone out and I shit you not for some reason starts recording an audio file (this was on a shit Nokia ph9ne at the time, and the quality is already shit on these things, but recording nonetheless), not for anything paranormal, but thinking about it now, I don't remember for the life of me what she was trying to record, point is, as she's recording we're all three standing there, when all of this sudden about 2-4 feet to my right, we all hear the most unsettling, blood curdling, just nasty woman's scream for a solid 2 seconds. Immediately being like ""what in the fuck was that?"" Even getting so worked up that we called the police who didn't find anything after showing up 20 minutes later. Best part? My sister the next day realized she had been recording this audio file. So she goes into her phone to review it, realizing she had never thought to stop the recording.... but there it was in her phone, so we listen back to it, everything is normal, you can hear us talking right up until this scream, which when this happens in the recording you hear us go quiet, then a very static type silence, and then you hear us all go ""what in the fuck was that?"" And then the recording cuts off a few seconds later. I always said it was a fox, but with how loud it was and how close it was, that sound should have been on this recording, and it most definitely was not. Thoughts?

Now i have I hard time with these last 2 stories, as they are the only visual experiences I have, and to me, are the absolute hardest to explain. Kinda leaves me feeling out of my wits even thinking about them let alone about to be typing it all out. 

Story 3) So to start, my mom was always a night owl, no exception even when we lived with her until 2005. I think this was somewhere around 2002 or 2003, the bedroom I was in, was right next to where the kitchen was, and you in fact could see right out into the kitchen, but couldn't see the table where we sat from here as the angle cut off that view, but it would've been off to the right of the bedroom door looking out. I remember waking up about 3 or 4 am or so, and looking out and seeing the dining room light on, and hearing my mom using her sewing machine at the table. So I yelled for her to come in there. I hear the machine stop, and she comes to the doorway, I just remember the most menacing horrifying mean look on her face as she just stood there, staring right at me, no words, no nothing, just this look like why the fuck are you talking to me right now? I don't really remember at this point if I said or did anything while she was stood there doing this, but just as quick as she was standing there, she just as quickly still with no words at all, just turned first her head away, and then her body followed suit, and then she just walked away. (This as most would assume is VERY much unlike most anyone's mom) I very much remember as soon as she was out of sight I started SCREAMING and crying, and yet again I hear her getting up from her sewing machine, this time a little more frantic, she comes in asking ""what's wrong?"" with the classic mom calming down horrified kid going on, so I told her what I'd literally just saw, and she said very plainly, that she had not just been in here and that she'd been sewing the whole time. And it is not like my mom to just come in and stare me down menacingly like that. Especially at 3 in the morning to scare me. Thoughts?

Story 4) my least favorite of these. I don't like even thinking about this one, but it's the one I wanted to bring here most as I just wanna know what others may think this thing is. So again, much like the last story, it's 3-4 in the morning, I'm in the same exact bedroom, bottom bunk, sister in on top bunk, this time everyone is asleep, all lights in the house off, and it's pretty quiet. I hear what I believe is a slightly heavy load in our dryer, or maybe the washer washing a little off balance. This sound wakes me all the way up because it just seems weird. So I roll over to get more comfy and I open my eyes a bit, as I'm looking around, I see what is some movement toward the kitchen, now again, you can see from this room out into the kitchen, but not the dining area, what you saw from my perspective is the island in the kitchen where the sink was, and you could see a little of the far side of our living room behind that, so I'm kinda scanning the kitchen listening to this weird sound I keep hearing, and that's when I see it. I can't say it was standing, as I saw no legs, but ""standing"" or stood behind the island but extremely tall, is this very plain almost 2d looking man. All white, no features whatsoever, no face, no nothing, as you looked down his body, it appeared to be more faint, but still a definite white figure or person just stood there. At first I'm thinking it's headlights hitting the window from a car outside, but then I realize that this thing has a cowboy type hat on, and not only that, it seems like it is taking this hat off, and like tipping it's hat in my direction, like it's tipping it's hat at me almost.  Now at this point I'm genuinely trying to make sure I'm 100% awake, and I am, so I go back to looking because naturally, I just cannot look away now. And it just repeats the same exact movements over and over. Pulls the hat down, puts it back on, pulls it down, then back on. All the while this weird sound still happening. So I'm trying to justify it in my mind by thinking somehow the neighbor kid is playing a prank on me and is somehow outside the window that's a bit behind this thing using some sort of puppet or something. But when I realize how stupid a thought this is, that's when I started screaming. My sister wakes up, and asks what the hell is going on, and I tell her exactly what I see and I ask her if she sees it too. Oddly no, she doesn't at all, this makes me scream more, this time waking up my mom, who as she comes into the kitchen turns on the light. It disappeared in that moment. Though I still hear the strange sound so I ask my mom what the sound is, and if the washer was going, she goes and looks, neither machine is running, and for whatever reason this woman takes one look at me, feels my head to see if I have a fever (which I didn't lol) and then tells me I have a fever and that that's why I'm seeing stuff like that. So I try and calm, she leaves the room, and turns the kitchen light back off, and sure enough there this guy is again, still tipping that hat over and over. I managed to roll over and fall asleep somehow after. I still mention this story to my sister, and she still very vividly remembers every bit. I always said it was hat man, but the thing is, what I've read and heard on hat man, is not anything like this. My mother later also recounted this story, and later told me that though she didnt see or hear what i did, she only told me i had a fever and stuff to calm me down, and she knew that it wasnt a fever causing it. Thoughts?

Avon-6,None,False,False,False,11pasqx,False,False,t3_11pasqx,Help Identifying a Spirit,"Hello everyone,

I (M22) am going to a college in Ohio. I live in a fraternity house that used to belong to the town (the school buys out properties and houses students in them). My house has been displaying some… interesting… encounters. 

Last year (around February or March), one of my housemates and I were talking in the hallway outside of the bathroom. We were there for at least 30 minutes, bathroom was empty, no one went in or out. Then the shower suddenly turned itself on. For context, the shower handle is one that points to the ground when off, and rotates counter clockwise to turn it on. We looked at each other, and went to check it out. The handle was turned 90 degrees counter clockwise. I turned it off, and we resumed our conversation.

Last semester (around September), I was at E-Sports practice. One of my friends had sent me a SnapChat of my room from the outside, asking what I was doing. When I opened the photo, there was a figure standing in my room. This was more concerning considering my room is a single, and I am the only one with a key (outside of skeleton keys kept by campus security).

At this point, we had assumed it was the spirit of the old man who, conveniently enough, passed away in the room that I’m in.

At the end of last semester (around early December), my girlfriend (F20) and I were sitting on my bed, talking. We heard a voice outside of my door. Both of our heads snapped in the direction, as it was either a young or female voice, and rest of the house is male. When we asked the others about it, (who were all downstairs, no one was outside my door), they all swear they didn’t hear anything, or do anything.

A few weeks ago, I, my girlfriend, one of my frat brothers, and his girlfriend were in the living room playing Mario Kart when there was a sudden loud bang. We all went to check it out. The shower curtain rod had fallen from its fastened spot. 2 years living there, and it never fell before.

Finally, last night was one of the weirdest. I had heard the same voice from last December, and it was trying to speak to me inside my own head. There was what seemed to be radio interference (best I can describe), as it kept cutting out. It began to imitate sounds outside. I’d hear a car drive by, then a few moments later, hear a distorted version of it in my head. After this went on for a while, it screamed at me, “F***ING LISTEN!!!” (Censored, ofc).

I hadn’t planned on discussing this, hoping it was a dream, until my girlfriend told me she heard a growl this morning, and asked if I had experienced anything.

Our conclusion as of now is that there are 2 spirits in the house. The old man, who is peaceful, and whatever this other thing is. Any assistance on identifying it, or general advice would be welcome. Thank you in advance to everyone’s help!




Updated Information as of February 22nd, 2023:

My fraternity brother (M20), his girlfriend (F19), my girlfriend, and I took turns going under with the Estes Method. We got some partial information when the other three were under, but the spirit seemed to be extremely happy to speak to me, as it yielded the most responses. 

This is going to sound weird, and I am still having trouble processing it all, but it seems that the spirit “wants” me. I’m not sure exactly what it means by that, but it definitely doesn’t sound good. For example, when asked “What do you want?”, the spirit would respond “him”, whilst I was under.

My girlfriend has a somewhat special connection to energy (I don’t know the official term, but she’s an empath, and feels that she can control how the energy flows through her, I don’t know if I’m even describing that correctly). She has been using her energy to protect me, and the spirit knows it. It repeatedly was telling her to leave the room, leave the house, and not to come back. We tested having her leave the room, and the aggressiveness increased, resulting in my quitting when I heard a voice scream “HE WILL BE MINE”. Chilled to the bone, I removed the headphones and blindfold, and called the session to a stop.

Since doing the Estes Method about a week ago, most of the activity has died off, with the exception of things occasionally falling off of their sound resting places, the TV randomly turning on, off, or pausing, and I am having a hard time staying asleep. 

A few days ago, my girlfriend and I both tested positive for Covid, although I doubt it’s connected to this spirit, it definitely has not helped settle any nerves, and we are now quarantined to my room.


Hopefully this added info helps anyone who might have an idea of what’s going on, or the previous commenters with additional thoughts of what to try next.

Thank you to everyone who has prayed, thought of, or tried this far to help, and to anyone in the future who does the same.


Updated info as of March 12:


Note: this was written right after the incident in to my notes on my phone, so I could document the encounter, and check for grammar later.

I thought I had heard my girlfriend talking to me. She told me that she was missing me. She told me that she loved me. She told me that she is with me. Then I thought she told me to open my eyes, so I did so. I was met with the face of our Squishmello, Willy the Dragon. I began shaking violently, my heart racing and hearing a pounding in my head. I was completely terrified. I was unable to speak, trying to rouse her. I was trying to tap her with my foot, but to no avail. All of a sudden it stopped, and I am now typing this. I have never felt that way before. I have never had this occurrence before, and I am extremely freaked out. I don’t think I’m sleeping for the rest of the night.

Thoughts after reflection of the event:

I don’t know if it was the beginning phases of a possession, a panic attack, sleep paralysis, or a combination of a few of them. I have had an anxiety attack before, but this was a completely different feeling and experience. I’ve done some research online, but have not found anything useful yet.

If anyone else stumbles upon this, and has any idea of what may have happened, please tell me. I’m still freaked out.",14,11.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ghoststories/comments/11pasqx/help_identifying_a_spirit/,False,2023-03-12 09:56:31,False,False,False,1.0,,,,

This video was taken in our backyard, 3 sides surrounded by woods. In the immediate beyond the backyard the background is a very steep hillside & in the distance is a nearby small town, about 3 miles away. 

My and I wife were asleep when about 1:00 am I was awaken to the sound of running water. I looked throughout the house, no source of running water. I looked outside & I saw random lights skirting the backyard, so I videoed what I saw.

Before I started to video, I fully opened the crank out windows & shot the video through the screen. Point is, there is no way these lights were a reflection off the window. Also, due to the steep hillside, there is no way these lights are from flashlights. 

Several other points
-I was taking the video from the 2nd floor which due to the landscape pitch is about 15' above the backyard. No way are these flashlights. 
- the ""flashing lights"" were between the woods & the house, directly above the back yard. There are no obstacles between the woods & the house.

She was old and I was ready for her to go, but the house still felt empty. So, I went to get a rescue kitten and ended up making one of the best friends I have ever had the pleasure of being around. Mace was the sweetest little boy, always wanting to be next to people and loved. He would sit on my lap and play video games with me, explore my office at work, and just be a little goofball. It seemed like he always did his best to keep me laughing. Not to mention he legitimately did nothing wrong; he never throwing up or having an accident anywhere and was exceptionally clean.

Fast forward seven months and my girlfriend and I took a week long vacation. My mother had mentioned he wasn't eating as much, but we both thought he just missed me. Towards the end of my vacation he stopped eating entirely and when I got home he had noticably lost weight. I spoonfed him some wet food and hung out with him the day after I got back. The next morning, my mother had brought him to the vet where we learned he had FIP and was going to die in the coming days. His organs were floating in fluid and at that point it started affecting his brain. We elected to put him down instead of let him suffer, a decision I'm still not sure was the right one. I just didn't want my friend to suffer.

Even as he died he was rubbing against my beard and nuzzling into my arms. I haven't stopped crying since I buried him next to my dog.

The other night though, I saw him at my feet when I was getting water in the middle of the night. Clear as day. I thought I was going crazy, but was still happy nonetheless that he was checking up on me. Just an hour ago, my mother called me to her room to tell me that that her pillow had an impact and then was vibrating. He always jumped on that one pillow in order to wake her up for snuggles. Later in the night, she heard meowing. 

A few days prior at my girlfriend's house, I heard meowing from downstairs and then saw her cat (one who can not meow) run up with zoomies. only to return down just as excited

Maybe I'll write the full long ass story tomorrow since it's already late but in a nutshell I woke up at 3am, turned around in bed and saw this shadow. I didn't freak out much since ive always been the type to rationalize everything and at the time I thought maybe I was just sleepy and imagining things (I wasn't groggy.. not even sleepy). Rubbed my eyes but it was still there. After what seemed like hours of me staring at this thing it turned its head to look at me. My heart dropped and I was paralyzed in fear (I had stood up in bed after initially seeing it ) 

Few minutes of staring at this thing that was now staring me down too it walked forward. At this point there was no logical explanation, no rationalizing it. I wanted to scream like a little girl and I did open my mouth but nothing came out. 

It walked just before going behind a desk I had and kneeling down to the point it was completely out of view. After what seemed like an eternity of me waiting for whats next I got the balls to stand up and check behind the desk. No one was there. 

I wasnt imagining it. It wasnt even sleep paralysis, I had moved so many times during this, eyes wide open, full thoughts and thinking. This thing was literally interacting with me. I can't think of one instance where I was genuinely scared shitless before this, its like this thing could sense the fear in me. 

It's been years and I swear to this day every time I'm in bed with the lights off and roll over theres still this part of me that begs ""please don't be there, please don't be there"" or turning off the lights at night and walking around ill avoid looking around fearing ill see that thing again. Never have thought and I hope I never do

I just cant get over how this thing seemed to toy around with me, taunting me. I'm just trying to figure out of this thing is real looking from my bed, I rub my eyes. Still there, I stand up in my bed, it's still there. I KEEP STARING at this shadow for minutes trying to figure out what it is, how or what is casting this perfectly shaped silhouette of a man, getting more terrified by the second after exhausting every possible explanation in my head and then it suddenly turns its fucking head to look at me?? You cant tell me that thing wasnt taunting me. Its like it sensed the fear and was saying/ confirming ""yes I'm real"" Then after minutesof staring each other walking and squatting down? 

Call me crazy but that thing was no ""ghost"" it sucked the fear out of me,  interacted with me, moved, and made an attempt to hide.

Intrepid-External622,None,False,False,False,11q2tmw,False,False,t3_11q2tmw,Some of the paranormal experiences my family has had,"     Sorry if this is hard to understand. I am writing this at 2:30 in the morning and can't sleep. Anyway, my family has always had stories of the paranormal. The first thing I ever heard of was a story from my mom. When she was younger, her and her sister were sitting on a bed in an upstairs bedroom. My grandma and their old dog were out at the time so it was just my grandpa, mom, and aunt. So, they were sitting on the bed talking when it started violently shaking. Nothing else in the room was moving. Needless to say, they were scared so they ran downstairs to my grandpa to explain what happened.

      At first he brushed them off and told them to go back to playing. Then, upstairs there were loud footsteps across the hallway. That's when my grandpa offered to go get ice cream. About a decade later I was born and a year after that my brother. After a couple years, we moved back into my grandparents house due to some things I won't get into. At this point I was around 3-4 and me and my brother were sharing a room which also just so happened to be the same room as the first story. I heard about this one from my mom as well.

      One morning around 1 am my mom walked into our room to tell us to go to bed. I guess she heard me telling my brother to go to sleep and stop playing with our toys because he was being loud. She turned on the light to see a mess of toys on the ground but my brother was asleep. About 3 years later my mom got back into dating and we moved into an apartment with her boyfriend after about a year or two. He is now my legal dad but that isn't relevant. The apartment on the other hand is. Around first or second grade my grandma on my dad's side died. This hit me really hard and I was struggling with it. We lived on the same road of the cemetery where she was buried and a creek led from the cemetery to the apartment. Growing up I always heard spirits travel through water.

        Eventually I decided to just ask for guidance or to somehow see her again. About a week or two later, I woke up in a cold sweat and my covers were half off. I rubbed my eyes and tried looking around. I was on the top bunk of a bunk bed and the door was at the foot of my bed. As I looked around, I noticed something at the foot of my bed. It looked like my grandma was in the corner of the ceiling above my door. I quickly grabbed my covers and threw them over my head. I fell back asleep after a while. That morning I asked my dad about it. From what he said, earlier that month he woke up to my mom sitting upright in bed one morning pointing to above their door and staring. My dad started asking her what was wrong but she didn't say anything. About 5 minutes later she snapped out of it and said she just saw my grandma. That master bedroom was creepy too. There was one story I heard where my mom and dad were watching a movie in the living room while me and my brother were out. My dad noticed my mom was looking down the hallway a lot so he looked. When he looked he saw a freaking foot disappear back into their room.

         Around third grade we moved to a house owned by my dad's boss. It was the first night there and I had set my room how I wanted it. I decided to get on my tablet and play some games while sitting in a beanbag chair. I felt like I was being watched so I looked up and saw a shadow figure run across my door. I explained it to my dad again and he told me it was the house settling which worked as an explanation in my 10 year old mind. Three days later, my dad went back to the house for his lunch break. I should've said this earlier but his job was a walking distance from the house. He was eating his lunch when he heard loud footsteps in the hallway. He searched the house and found nothing. The next day my mom was home alone. She was carrying a hamper to the laundry room when she saw a shadow figure run from the kitchen to the laundry room.

         For a while everything settled down. There were still small things like my bedroom door handle randomly twisting and my door popping open while I was the only one home and stuff like that but about a year after we moved in we were watching a movie. My dad was in the master bedroom and decided to go into my brother's room to look for something. My brother was and still is a big fan of motorcycles and he had a large pull back motorcycle that was kept in a plastic container. When my dad opened the door he saw that motorcycle rolling across the floor with the case open next to it and when my dad looked at the motorcycle it fell over.

        Again stuff settled down for years until middle school. My sister was born a year before and we bought her this walker thing to help her learn to walk. One day we were all sitting in the living room. My sister's walker and high chair were sitting in the middle of the room. We were watching a show when out of nowhere her walker started moving and somehow the front lifted and ended up getting stuck under the high chair. We were all stunned and had no idea what to think. Around the same time we put in motion sensor light switches for the hallway. It was mainly so it was easier to move with my sister. We started having problems with those too. It still happens occasionally where there will be nothing in the hallway and the hallway lights will turn on. Currently all I deal with is stuff in my room falling over and I pretty much just say stop and then I'm good. Well those are my stories of paranormal experiences my family has had over the years.

This was around 11 years ago, I was 12 years old. This house was very old and was right next door to a cemetery (if you read a previous post of mine you’d see that my parents moved to another house afterwards that is next door to two cemeteries… very odd). The owners of our local funeral home also owned the house and mainly used it for storage of caskets. The house honestly did not make me feel uneasy in any way and my family members always said they felt comfortable there too. From time to time, my mom said she would hear faint whispers that sounded like children talking when she was home alone and my siblings and I were at school. The main incident that we all vividly remember to this day is what we called “the whistler”. This only ever happened when everyone was home and usually when we were all in the kitchen. A whistling clear as day would make its way up the steps from the basement, through the living room, down the hall, and stopping right before it got to the kitchen. I haven’t ever heard even a human whistle this clearly and smoothly for that long of a time.

Mjferner,None,False,False,False,11qcgtm,False,False,t3_11qcgtm,Moving into a haunted house,"I (29F) am in the final stages of purchasing an old farmhouse. It's a humble 100 year old house on 157 acres in rural, northern Canada. It's a 3 hour move from my current place, which I had to unfortunately leave due to a physically absuive relationship. This area stood out to me as it's relatively close to where my grandparents lived and farmed. It's perfect, and everything I want in a home.

Yesterday, I had a tour of the property with the current owner who has lived there for the last 10 years. The house has 2 doors, and when I asked why he doesn't use the side door (that has a large mudroom) he casually mentioned his daughter (early 20s) is scared of the basement. Jokingly, I said ""what, is there ghosts?"" To which he replied, ""yes actually there is"". My next question was ""are they good or bad"" and he reassured me they were ""good"". 

He then told me he sees a man downstairs sometimes, and occasionally sees him outside walking towards the shop. There's a woman that spends her time in the kitchen when he sees her. He has never seen the children, but he often hears them playing outside. I asked if there was any family tradegy that occured on the property and he said that the only story he knows of was the original owners who built and homesteaded there lost a child at a young age, and because it was winter they had to store him in the cistern in the basement for the winter until the ground thawed. 

I didn't have any negative feelings in the house. I did feel a sense of comfort, but I've also had bad energies in a house previously so I can't lie and say I'm not a little nervous. 

A good friend of mine is clairvoyant and I brought it up to her. She assured me that they are not harmful spirits and they have attachments to their first home.  She said she sensed they liked me. She went on to say that the current owner advised me of them out of respect for them (there are no disclosure laws of haunted houses where I live) and as long as I live with respect to them everything will be good.

Is there anything I should be mindful of when moving in? Anything I should do? Any kind of smudge or anything I should place in the home? I've heard not to put a mirror facing my bed, and I'm just wondering if there is anything else I can do. I don't want to push them away, but I don't want to open myself to anything negative either. 

This really is a first for me purposely moving into a place with known entities living in it. I will also say, I live alone for the majority. I have dogs and cats, and a new boyfriend who seems to be a little uneasy about this news. However, my mantra the last few months has been, ""I am capable of anything.

Puzzleheaded-Note221,None,False,False,False,11qrnka,False,False,t3_11qrnka,An off-putting art class,"This may not be exceptionally scary to adults, but to fifth-grade me, years ago, this encounter was terrifying. If the tag is wrong, I apologize. 

I’ll include some background for context because that’s usually my favorite part of stories. Anyways. 

My hometown grew in population steadily since its founding in 1889. It’s a city wedged between a college town and the state capitol, with a major interstate cutting through, so naturally the city has grown busy. With cheap living, beautiful parks, great schools, it’s an ideal place to settle down and have children or enjoy a quiet life if that’s what you desire. 

The high school was overgrown before I was l born in ‘99, so they built an even bigger high school in ‘68, followed by two more high schools on the west and south sides of town in ‘88 and ‘08. The old high school still stands and people or businesses can rent out the classrooms. I’ve seen restaurants, office spaces, and studios come and go there. 

One business was an artist who held her studio and classes out of several of the rooms.

After exhibiting interest in art, I told my mom I wanted to take some classes and she enrolled me at a studio there. I’d never been to the building before, it was old but I liked it. My art teacher delighted me. I took some private classes there in fifth grade. I enjoyed my teacher a lot and we had great conversations. I was one of her older students and we often chatted about life and outside interests while we both worked. 

I’ll call my art teacher Mindy to protect identities. 

I trusted Mindy. We would talk about anything and everything. I must have asked if she believed in the paranormal, a childhood interest of mine, because it wasn’t long after she told me the school housed spirit visitors. We spoke of that frequently. 

One day, I noticed a to-do list she had posted to one of the walls. I was snoopy and read it. One of the lines said “Clean out black hole.” I asked her what the Black Hole was and she said it was a room down the hall that was used for storage. I asked if we could go see it because I thought it was super funny that they called it the “Black Hole.” She agreed and took me down the hall. 

The school was old and creaky but never unfriendly. This room was different though. 

It was pitch dark. She said they had no idea why there wasn’t electricity in that room and that no matter what they tried, they couldn’t get the lights on. Just in that room though.

Like any storage room, it was cluttered. Thrown about were desks, chairs, bookshelves, even old sinks and toilets were shoved inside. There was no light from the outside or from any bulbs in the room. Some of the windows were painted black. On other windows, the glass was broken out and was replaced with wooden boards. The room was freaky. 

Mindy told me a bit about the room. She told me the Black Hole housed a spirit of an older gentleman, one who wasn’t necessarily a happy guy. She spoke to him and told him to leave us alone, and we’d be out of there soon. In some words, the vibe was off in that room. 

Like I said before, the paranormal was a point of interest in my childhood for a long time. 

Fast forward to one of my last classes there. I’m painting in illustrations on a wall Mindy had sketched out already. Mindy left me on my own that night, she was in a meeting about the space in the room right next to where I was, and she wasn’t far. She told me to grab her if I needed her. I wasn’t necessarily planning on needing her. 

So I’m painting. Not really thinking about much just making sure my colors don’t blend together. It was coming along nicely. I was painting and deep in my own thoughts. 

I see something down the hall in the corner of my eye. Looked like a man, but it was gray and fuzzy. Almost like TV static in human form. I looked. Nothing there. What scared me though was that he was standing in front of the Black Hole. I knew instantly who it was and my first thought was “He is mean.” I got chills, but it was okay. I tried to ignore it, and went back to my work. I was used to seeing things out of the corner of my eye, anyways. Could have been anything. 

Not even five minutes later it happens again. Exact same figure. I looked through my peripherals for a minute before I finally looked at it head on. Same figure. Gone again. 

 It is not uncommon for me to see things in the corner of my eye and when I look it’s not there anymore. But it never happens twice. Never twice with the same being. I was terrified. I’d never encountered anything like this before and it could have been a reflection, a shadow, anything, but I can’t misinterpret how my body reacted. Sheer fear. Flight or fight activated. I went and told my teacher and she seemed upset. Not at me, but just… I don’t know. She told him to go away and stop bothering me. She knew what it was and what was bothering me. 

My body had chills and the second time I saw it, I went completely cold. Like adrenaline and fear and everything mixed together was pumping through me. 
To this day, I know what I saw. I saw that man. I know I did. He may have been just watching. He probably was. I just don’t know. 

Years later she moved her studio due to safety reasons. My mom told me that. I don’t know if it was just an old building and dangerous in that way, or if it was more.

So one day, my brother and my auntie were alone at home (this is in Bangladesh btw) and they get a knock on the door. My auntie looks out the peephole and saw a lady with a burqa on (burqa is an outer garment worn by some muslim women that covers both the body and face). So they couldn’t see the woman’s face. My auntie didn’t want to open the door so she waited for the woman to go away but then she started banging on the door to which my auntie got scared and double locked the door. At this point, my brother was aware of the woman at the door and was scared. We lived on the 2nd floor of an apartment and the apartment had 6 floors. We owned the 2nd, 4th and 6th floor. The rest of the apartments were occupied by uni students and they were never home. Anyway, after a couple minutes, she went upstairs and my auntie and brother were listening to her footsteps and heard her going up to 6th floor. Above the 6th floor was the roof which was always locked and only the people who lived in the apartment and the guard had the key. At this point, no one was living on the 6th floor so there was no reason for her going up there and there was no reason for her to go to roof either because there was nothing up there. My auntie and brother just let it go and waited for her to come back down but she never did. They wanted to check the roof but they were scared so they got the guard and went with him to check the roof. it was locked and when they got in, there was no one. The guard never saw anyone enter the apartment complex.

I was pretty close to her children even though they were older than me. That exact same day, the apartment we were staying in caught on fire. the area near the front door had been engulfed in flames, as my mother says she had to run to the balcony. When she did, there was a man telling her to jump and that he'd catch her. She was terrified of doing such a thing, but obviously more terrified of burning to death or suffocating. My mother would go on to jump and the man would catch her and proceed to ask if she was okay- to which she would reply that she was, thanking him as well.

My mother tells me that there were a few people outside already looking at the fire, and that the man would follow her while walking towards them. Strangely enough, none of them asked about the man that saved her, or even noticed him do so. She would strike up a conversation with one of the onlookers for what she tells me was literally about 5 seconds, bringing up the guy that saved her and turning her head back to look at him. Except, he was gone. None of the observers even claim to have seen anyone there with my mother, and there's no way he was able to run or walk away without anyone seeing him. He just vanished. To this day, my mother and i believe he was a guardian angel that saved her, as the circumstances around this event just seem very strange.

This is a long story so bear with me, please.

In between my freshman and sophomore year, I moved to a new house. We had three bedrooms and two bathrooms, the master bedroom belonged to the couple who lived there prior, and the other two belonged to their son and a guest if needed. I got the son's old room. 

The reason the house was for sale was because the man and his son were looking for a smaller house as the mother had passed away. From what? I have no idea. 

The first couple days to weeks in the house I had awful headaches. I didn't really think much of that at the time, since migraines are a common thing in my family, especially my mother and myself. The following events took place over the next two to three years, and got worse over time. 

Some days, I'd come home and take a nap after class. For about one or two hours usually. On more than a few occasions, I had horrible nightmares, and then one day they stopped and I would be standing in my room, watching myself sleep. My room was exactly how everything was laid out normally. For example if I put my backpack at the entryway of my door, it was there and I could physically see it. I was just watching myself sleep, which was already eerie. 

After a few minutes, I'd see *something* moving up my bed and feel pressure on my neck. I could feel my chest holding the weight of something heavy. I could feel everything and I remember vividly being slapped our punched by something. On more than one occasion, I had marks on my neck or arms from where I was choked or scratched or punched. 

I experienced this until I moved out of the house when I was 21. 

My only explanation, if it is paranormal, is that the entity I was dealing with was the mother, who passed away in the home years prior to my arrival. Perhaps it was because I was in the son's room and I was unwelcome.

Bright-Conference943,None,False,False,False,11q2ixk,False,False,t3_11q2ixk,Can someone tell me what is happening?,"So recently, times have been somewhat unsettling. I’ve had my encounters, but none of which have I been concerned about. Once I head screaming in a dark forest which only I could hear, but luckily my friends believed me when I said we needed to get out of there. I’ve seen various shadow figures, heard voices, but none of them have felt threatening. But recently, times have been getting strange. I’m in a tight friend circle with my sister, her boyfriend, and me. We are all juniors and seniors in high school. 2 nights ago, my sister and her boyfriend were out driving late at night around our neighborhood. Oddly enough, lights seem to shut off in a pattern. The street lights, one by one, would cut off, following the vehicle. They claim that one home was completely dark as they passed, and the top floor just randomly turned on as they passed, flickering rapidly, and once they were a few doors down, it had stopped. Lamp after lamp, the darkness would follow them, and as the darkness followed them, their intuitive senses began to flare. About halfway home, a deer appeared in the middle of the road, and it would not move. Our area is heavily populated with deer, so this occurrence is normal, except for the fact that the deer are usually very skiddish. normally, the deer would be gone within seconds, but this one stayed. They said it looked weird, almost human, with whites in its eyes. He honked, and it stayed. So he carefully went into the opposite lane to pass it. When they finally got home, the house directly behind our backyard was completely alive. You could see directly inside it, the den, the kitchen, the living room, all of it. But all of the sudden, all of the lights just shut off at once. Our neighborhood is almost exclusively made of ranch style homes from the 60s/70s. These houses are designed with multiple breakers, and no option to cut the main power sources of the homes. You have to do it section by section. We found it very odd that the entire house just shut off. Now move forward to tonight, I am up making a late night snack in the kitchen. Our kitchen is full of windows where you can see directory into the backyard. I get a horrible intuitive sense, like i was being watched. I go to lock the back door and turn the porch light off, where i see a still deer with human like eyes, staring into my soul. This animal gives me chills, but i disregard my intuition and eat my sandwich on the couch with my dog. out of nowhere, my dog suddenly forgets i have food (which has literally never happened) and becomes intensely focused on the windows on the back door. I thought this seemed peculiar, and the feeling of discomfort grew into entirely being unsettled, because my dog started growling and barking, and even started shaking. I can’t shake the feeling that something is here, and i’ve also been having nightmares about screaming in my backyard where the deer shows up, but when i go to check it out i am killed by an unspeakably terrifying presence. the dream has come off and on for the last month, and slowly it feels like the dream is becoming a reality. Whatever is out there, it wants me to know it’s there, because the feeling i have is crippling.",4,5.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11q2ixk/can_someone_tell_me_what_is_happening/,False,2023-03-13 06:52:40,False,False,False,0.73,,,,

I woke up abruptly at 5:50 am because my doorbell kept ringing continuously, as if someone was holding their finger on the bell. I woke up my fiancé (he’s a super heavy sleeper and didn’t hear it) so he could go downstairs with me to check. 

Before my fiancé reached the door, I made him check the spy hole first. He didn’t see anything, so he went to the side window to see if anyone was there - still no one. 

Since the doorbell was still ringing, I opened  the door to check the doorbell button… and the doorbell stopped ringing as soon as I opened the door.

Legitimately the most terrifying thing ever. I was so creeped out that I was shaking, haha. That’s some horror movie shit right there!

When I was little, around 5-8 (i don’t remember) I would always leave my TV on. I remember distinctly that the Bratz live action movie was playing. My dad wanted me to go into my room and turn off my TV since I wasn’t watching it. 
I went in and go to turn my TV off, but I looked down and saw a green hand coming out from underneath my bed. It was slowly coming out, reaching for my feet. 
This scared me so bad. Now I have a really hard time having my feet exposed-example: 
- feet next to a couch or furniture that has a space from the floor to the bottom of the furniture. 
- shower curtain too close to my feet
and other things like that. 
I was so surprised when I looked up ‘green hand from underneath bed’ there were a lot more than I thought there’d be. Most people’s experiences have been so similar, it was insane to me.

WLGbureaucrat,None,False,False,True,11qw2fz,False,False,t3_11qw2fz,Experience with my grandmother passing away,"Hi all,

My grandmother (who raised me) recently passed away. More like a mother to me, she took me off my drug-addict parents when I was young, becoming a single mother again when she was in her 60s. She did an incredible job, and life for me would have turned out very differently for had it not been for her intervention. Needless to say, we had an extremely close relationship.

As I grew into a successful adult (I'm 28 now), roles reversed, as she became older and sicker (a diabetic who ended up requiring multiple amputations, dialysis and finally developed the early symptoms of what was speculated to be vascular dementia). She passed away from sepsis after a 6-week long battle in hospital. I was lucky enough to be in a position that I could take that time off work, and was at the hospital with her every day until she passed.

Her hospitalisation, however, was long and protracted, and quite traumatic. As with many older patients with sepsis/blood poisoning, she developed delirium, which honestly was indistinguishable from psychosis at times. This included seeing what she believed to be dead people in her roomand moving about in the corridor, and her calling me at night screaming about some of her hallucinations.

I would rush to the hospital, and once there, she would calm down. In her more sober-minded moments, she would recall these incidents in a level of detail I wouldn't expect, and fully believed what she was seeing was real. As a non-believer, I rushed to attribute these to her delirium but I would like to hear your thoughts?

Being her next of kin I was in charge of arrangements when she passed. And it was the day she passed that my partner and I had an experience that would lead us to doubt our previously held beliefs about the afterlife.

We were staying in her house, looking after her dog and two cats, who she adored. She passed away around 4:15am, and I received a call from the hospital at about 4:30am. About ten minutes before the phone rang, my partner woke up to her dog, sleeping on the end of our bed, moving in a way like she was being petted. She also sensed a strange feeling in the house, almost like electricity in the air. This lead her to wonder whether my grandmother had passed, and moments later, the phone rang, waking me up and informing me she had died.

As I woke up, I too felt a certain strangeness in the air. Like the calm after a storm has passed with static still hanging in the air. After taking the call, I went into her bedroom to see one of her cats, looking up, meowing in a really strange rhythm at nothing. Soon after an object of meaning to her was inexplicably knocked off a table in her living room.

It really felt like her spirit rushed through the house, and then left. I haven't felt her presence since, and don't know what to believe.

She was my best friend, my twin soul and after 13 years of losing her, the pain is still fresh.She was killed when her drunk roomate crashed her motorbike with my cousin riding the pillion. My cousin never wanted to go out that night her roommate dragged her out and my cousin paid the ultimate price.

I often wondered if she has moved on, of she is not around us anymore.Cause initially after she died I could feel her presence around me. I saw her in my dreams, smelled her perfume and even heard her.

Two months after she died I went to her home for the first time and I couldn't sleep at night. We always slept together talking and singing late till night. I broke down and asked her for a sign. I then heard her voice, it sounded like it came from the radio but it was her. 


 I always felt her presence and for some reason I felt like she was trying to comfort me but I was freaking out so she was keeping her distance. It was heavy and heady. We are hindus and we have many rituals involved in helping a departed soul cross over. After her rituals were done I could no longer feel her.

 So I thought she was gone. But something happened today, after nearly 13 years that has me questioning things. As always her death anniversary sucks for me. I was getting ready to go to work and I was trying to get outfits. I couldn't find a decent shirt. I was already mopey and suddenly thought to  'Give me a sign she is around ' and suddenly i found an old blouse of hers that I still have. This blouse had been missing for a year. I thought my mom had thrown it away but finding it out of no where was weird considering that my mom had rearranged my wardrobe. It was under a few clothes that i was sure wasn't there before.

I started crying when i found it, it was such a soothing feeling. My question is did she really respond or was it a coincidence?",5,6.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Paranormal/comments/11qzzgk/did_she_send_me_a_message/,False,2023-03-14 07:45:41,False,False,False,0.75,,,,

KataG95,None,False,False,False,11qp1gk,False,False,t3_11qp1gk,"Anyone know anything paranormal about Hickson, Ontario Canada?","I hope the guy that told me his experience in this town is ok with me sharing his sorry, but a guy that I had a 1st date with told me a very peculiar happening when he used to live in this small town in Canada. 

He was renting a house from a landlord, and the landlord had told him the house is in great condition for it being built a while back when the town first became an area of populace for settlers. The landlord had said the house was all his to accommodate but his only rule was to not go downstairs b/c the stairs were in no shape to be going down. So sure enough he said he would abide by his request. Well you know how that goes with curiosity getting the best of people he eventually has the urge to push the washer and dryer out of the way of the basement door so he can explore the prohibited terrain. 

The first thing he notices that is odd once he opens the door and goes down the stairs is that his flashlight starts flickering. He says that is very strange for his flashlight to be acting like this b/c he knows for a fact that it was a fully charged battery. He  goes on to explain that he is a survivalist and always makes sure that he has a topped up battery at all times. Once he gets down to the bottom of the stairs he notices very old vintage toys, like a rocking horse, which I suppose isnt out of the usual, so he continues on. He notices his dog frantically running around the room in circles. He goes on to say that as he is exploring the room he notices it opens up into another room. Before he goes into the second room he explains that he flashed his light into the room and described a void, a black mass in the middle of the room. 

I am literally getting chills and its hard to type this as I recollect the story he told me. No lie.

This is not even the most fucked part of this event.

He enters the room with the dense void in the center of the room, as this void doesnt scare him enough to not abort the mission and go up the stairs already, what he notices when he enters the room is that in the middle where the void was it was much deeper like a swimming pool, say 10x15ft in dimension and that there was canals at every corner and in the middle of every side of this pool. In the middle of the pool is a chair and very dark staining on the floor around the chair...

He continues exploring around this room and notices on one of the walls there is boards nailed to the wall covering up an entry way underground..

By then he is already freaked out by the blood-letting pool so he goes upstairs.

After that he told me that there was strange apparitions around the house. He said that him and his now ex-girlfriend were getting ready for bed, relaxing in bed. He had explained that they kept the bathroom door closed to keep the dog out at night but he noticed through the key hole of the door since it was across the bed from where they were sitting that the light was on. But the creepy part was that there was a shadow moving back and forth across the bathroom that you could see light then shadow light then shadow light then shadow and so on...

He started doing some investigating about the place and that the town was hugely religious, Methodist more specifically. The churches around there had a common plant that was always around on the property, a white lilac that is symbolic of death. Hickson Ontario is known for their walking trails around there so he said he explored the area around his house and said that he found unmarked graves there as well. He had shown his mom pictures of the area and she said that there was orbs and high spiritual energy there. He did some more looking around and found some pictures of children at the churches and noticed they had very uncanny smiles that were very unsettling..

Does anyone know anything abnormal about this place? I tried doing my own research but I have a sneaking suspicion that you need to do a deep dive to find anything remotely of what I am looking for.
